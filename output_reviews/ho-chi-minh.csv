Phillip,Việt Nam,1.0,None.,"I booked a room at this hotel well in advance, received a confirmation number, and even called ahead to double-check. When I arrived, they told me there was no room available under my reservation. No apology, no assistance, no solution, just a blank stare and a ""nothing we can do"" attitude.
It became clear that this is nothing short of a scam. Not just my reservation, but many other ones in the same day.
Save yourself the stress and stay literally anywhere else. These people are a bunch of thieves and liars. Never again.
Tôi đã đặt phòng tại khách sạn này, nhận được mã xác nhận và thậm chí còn gọi trước để kiểm tra lại. Khi tôi đến nơi, họ nói rằng không có phòng nào được đặt dưới tên tôi. Không một lời xin lỗi, không sự hỗ trợ, không giải pháp – chỉ là cái nhìn trống rỗng và thái độ ""chúng tôi không thể làm gì"".
Rõ ràng đây chẳng khác gì một trò lừa đảo. Không chỉ riêng đặt phòng của tôi, mà còn nhiều người khác cũng gặp vấn đề tương tự trong cùng một ngày.

**UPDATE**: WOW! Don’t give me this fake apology - your message is full of lies. There was no confusion. I had a valid reservation, and you completely failed to honor it. Your staff didn’t help me at all, and now you're trying to twist the truth to make it sound like it was just a “miscommunication.” That’s 100% dishonest.
If you really had a room ready, why was I told there wasn’t one? Why was nothing done to fix the situation? Your team did nothing to support me, and now you’re just trying to avoid blame. ALSO, there were a bunch of people who had the same issue like me that date. Wanna proof? More than happy to send you and your team the full video.
Stop pretending like you care. Get your act together.
CẬP NHẬT: Đừng gửi cho tôi cái lời xin lỗi giả tạo đó – tin nhắn của bạn toàn là dối trá. Không hề có sự nhầm lẫn nào cả. Hôm đó có rất nhiều người gặp tình trạng giống như tôi. Muốn bằng chứng à? Tôi hoàn toàn sẵn sàng gửi cho bạn và đội ngũ của bạn toàn bộ video."

Minh,Việt Nam,1.0,Nào đã kịp ở đâu mà biết tốt ở đâu,Đã đặt phòng từ 1 tháng trước nhưng đến nơi thì không những nhà mình mà những gia đình khác đi từ xa đến cũng không được nhận phòng. Hỏi thì chối bay chối biến là bị lỗi nhưng khi mình cố hỏi nhân viên thì hóa ra là chủ ham lợi ích nên đã bùng phòng của các khách khác đã đặt trước để sát lễ cho thuê được với giá cao hơn nghe nói là 40 50 triệu. Khi đụng chuyện thì chủ trốn tránh trách nhiệm mà để cho 2 con bé nhân viên làm thuê chịu trận với khách. Đến nỗi các em khóc vì bị khách chửi mà bất lực không thể làm gì. Tôi sẽ cho công an vào cuộc xử lý. Thứ làm ăn chộp giật này đừng hòng tồn tại ở Sài Gòn
Binhdat,Vanuatu,10.0,"Nhân viên phục vụ chuyên nghiệp, lịch sự và hỗ trợ khách hàng rất tận tâm",
Mai,Việt Nam,1.0,"""Sự kiên nhẫn"" đến bất ngờ cho sự lừa đảo của cả ekip tại khách sạn. Kiên nhẫn lừa đảo đến phút cuối cùng, đối diện với rất nhiều khách.","Đây là 1 khách sạn lừa đảo với nhiều tên khác nhau theo thời gian. Tra trên google map là 1 tên khác, trên booking là 1 tên khác, và biển hiệu tại khách sạn lại là 1 tên khác. Thật kinh khủng vì cả trăm người bị lừa trong cùng 1 ngày. Họ vẫn nhận booking trong khi số phòng đã vượt giới hạn, sau đó đẩy qua 1 khách sạn khác tệ hơn nhưng giá vẫn giữ nguyên. Thậm chí để khách đợi 4-5 tiếng và không hề có bất kỳ đền bù nào cho khách hàng. Cần yêu cầu công an và sở văn hóa & du lịch can thiệp để hạn chế khách bị lừa. Rất rất bức xúc với cách làm ăn vô đạo đức như thế này. Không hiểu sao họ có thể tồn tại lâu dài với chiêu thức lừa đảo 1 cách trắng trợn tại trung tâm sầm uất nhất tại Tp. HCM"

Jeweleon,Quần đảo Virgin thuộc Hoa Kỳ,9.0,"Clean hotel, good service, friendly staff are big pluses.",
Kelly,Úc,8.0,Location,"The hotel itself was nice and clean, and the location was great—really convenient and easy to get around. At first, I found the staff a little unfriendly, but once I warmed up to them, they became much more pleasant and helpful.

Unfortunately, my last impression was a disappointing one. When I returned, I saw several families being turned away at the front desk due to overbooking. One family, who had travelled to see the 50-year anniversary celebration, had a young boy who was in tears—it was honestly heartbreaking. And it wasn’t just them; at least six families were in the same situation. What made it worse was that the hotel still had rooms available online—but at drastically inflated prices, sometimes 8 to 15 times what I had paid. That felt really unfair and left a sour taste at the end of an otherwise decent stay."

Their communication was inconsistent. Did not advise me that I needed to get my key reset on the day I extended my stay despite seeing me that same morning. Housekeeping at irregular times eg after 12pm on some days- I would argue this is quite late.  They really need to sort out this issue with the hotel name on google maps. The hotel appears to have identity crisis as it does not know if it is KAS hotel (visible sign still there), Walhalla (location on google maps which you need to use for Grab/taxi) or Saigon Premium. This should be sorted, reviews have been flagging it for months. Until it is sorted, all this should be clearly communicated to the customer upon reservation because the hotel is really letting itself down in this way if we have to rely on reviews to get the information."

Matthew,Úc,8.0,"Good size room, with fairly good amenities including a bath tub which is not common at this price. The bed was pretty comfortable and the room was clean.","It's the little things, the TV didn't work on arrival, so I informed them and came back after they said it had been sorted to find the same issue. A smart TV would be a welcome addition. They have an old school movie app box thing that is basically useless and has no movies or movie related apps installed.

The hotel seems to have a name complex and can't decide how to identify itself, on Booking.com it's Saigon Premium hotel, the sign out front says Kas Premium hotel and if you go on Grab app there was two other names, but Saigon Premium hotel was not listed. 
 
The room has tea and coffee making facilities, but weirdly you'll find the kettle in the wardrobe where the plug is located to boil it, but the cord is just a little too short to reach the outlet, so it semi hangs while boiling. The flooring has large gaps in sections. 

The breakfast included doesn't resemble anything near what it pictured on Booking.com. Even in the restaurant while arriving for my first ""Free"" breakfast I was asked what I wanted out of the fresh cooked items on the menu. To be shown a picture of 6 different items from omelette to other items. I decided to go with ""Eggs Opalo"" or something similar I can remember the name, but it looked good, fluffy eggs with avocado and tomato etc. Only to find out that when it came out it was just X2 Sunnyside up eggs on a plate, alone! Nothing else."

There’s no actual name on the building. It just says hotel.  Paid a very high price in a time of demand and regret it very much.  The room was barely passable. Check-in required some elaborate paperwork which was concerning.  Nonrefundable deposits, shabby interiors. Air-conditioning barely worked.  I feel like the staff were doing the best they could under the circumstances.  This place is best avoided, but probably be OK for a short stay."

Vivian,Mỹ,1.0,,"Absolutely Terrible Experience – Stay Away!

If I could give zero stars, I would. My parents flew from Da Nang to Saigon for the holiday weekend (April 28–May 1), and this hotel completely ruined their trip. First, they were given the wrong room—not the one we booked. Then, the next day, the staff had the nerve to ask them to move because apparently, the room they were staying in was “more expensive.” Why give it to them in the first place if that’s the case?

While waiting for a taxi in the lobby, my family overheard another shocking situation: a family who had flown all the way from Hanoi had paid a deposit, but the hotel gave their room to someone else who offered more money. Absolutely unprofessional.

To make things worse, the room smelled like fresh paint, and the bathroom was filthy—clearly not cleaned properly. Nothing like the photos online. This place is a scam and a complete disappointment. Save your money and avoid this hotel at all costs!"

Matilda,Vương Quốc Anh,4.0,"Freshly cooked eggs at breakfast.
The superior room we upgraded to had a nice view over surrounding roof tops and was quiet.","There were ants in the rooms. The first room we were shown had a trail of ants all across the floor. When I pointed this out to the receptionist they offered to get someone to clean it or show us an upgraded room (which we would need to pay extra for, although they did offer a small discount) as there wasn't another room of the same standard available. We decided to pay for the upgrade, but later I noticed this room also had ants in.
Beyond the new looking lobby the facilities are old and tired, the shower screen on the bath let all the water leak under it, the hairdryer kept cutting out, the carpet in the hallway was stained, there were gaps between the lino planks in the rooms and between the edges and the skirting boards - likely why there are ants. There's an inventory in your room of everything in it, along with a list of charges for things like a stain on your towel or bedsheets. The bed was hard and I noticed that the mattress protector was far too small for the mattress so you could see it through the thin sheet. Also the pinned location on booking.com takes you to the wrong place, you need to use the street address instead, and the sign on the outside said KAS premium hotel.
I get that it's an inexpensive hotel but earlier in our trip we stayed at the Anpha Boutique Hotel round the corner, which was the same cost but 100x better - clean, modern facilities and fantastic breakfast, go there instead."

Sylavong,Úc,1.0,,"First of all, there was no signage at the front of the hotel with the hotel name on it, so we couldn’t even find it when we first arrived to check-in. It seems like the hotel has multiple names on google maps, and it is not call Saigon Premium Hotel at all, except on bookings.com for some strange reason. The hotel is rundown and old, with dark and dingy hallways with poor lighting. As soon as we got into our room and turned the aircon on, within 20 mins it started gushing water out of it, and continued dripping throughout the entire night. We advised the front reception, and they called a plumber however as it was midnight, they said we had to wait until morning for them to come and look at it. They offered to change our room to another room, however we had already unpacked all of our belongings and as it was after midnight and we were tired from a 6 hour bus ride, we did not wish to relocate rooms at that point in time. I could not sleep throughout the night as the aircon dripping noise was loud and constant. We used bath towels to place underneath the aircon, and the towels were soaking wet in the morning and the tiled floor around the area was wet. I nearly slipped and fell as I walked to the bathroom in the morning. 

Do not book this hotel, as it is not worth paying $80 Aud per night; I would not even pay $40 per night for it. I do not believe the rating is accurate of this hotel’s standard, as many of the reviews do not seem genuine. I find it very hard to believe that someone would give it a rating above even 5 which it seems to suggest on booking.com that it has many ratings of. We ended up checking out after the two nights that we had already paid via bookings.com, and booking another hotel in HCM."

Upon arrival, I still couldn’t find the hotel through my Apple navigation.  My driver got out and talked to the men on the street and realized the hotel is actually Hotel Apec. 
I was mad and told the reception desk but they didn’t care much. I told them how much time I had wasted trying to locate the hotel and they gave some lame excuse. 
They should have atleast sent me a message saying that the hotel now had another name. Instead they try to message about booking taxi and stuff like that.

The tips is based on what you like to give and do not harassed guest to give 100% like other places.,"There are construction going on while I was there…they are fixing the entire floor and wall.  Not a good sight.  Beside that, they do not allow eating/ food in the room, or if yes, and there is smell extra charge. Towel that is dirty will be extra charged. I have never heard of this type of policy (outside the normal) of doing business and I myself also do rental and airbnb.  Food is ok, selection not good. Preferable Vietnamese food only as people travel want to explore Vietnamese food and culture. No need for American food"

The hotel is under construction and the rooms are just disappointing. By the time I got there I was just too tired for the traveling to cancel, so I stayed there.

Taiwo,Vương Quốc Anh,5.0,Hotel was ok considering price but pictures are very deceiving. It’s far from grand and has no spa so the name is essentially false advertising.

Ali,Hà Lan,2.0,,"Do NOT go tot his hotel. 
Firstly, the hotel changed its name, so our taxi driver had difficulty finding it. I read that other people had the same issue and that the hotel would fix it, but as of yet the name remains unchanged. Secondly, they gave us two small double rooms while we booked for one small double room and one superior double room. Only after we complained that one of the smells roomed terribly (they were not very cooperative with changing our rooms), did we get a superior double room. We only figured out later tjat we were supposed to have one from the beginning, if he hadn’t brought up the smell, we would have heen paying for a superior room while having the small one. Thirdly, they are still renovating the place. We didn’t have noise pollution, but the hallways and stairs on some floors were a mess.. concrete, dust, cigarette buds and all around just dirt laying on the floor. They didn’t bother cleaning up. Fourth, the rooms aren’t good. The pictures truly deceive you, the bedrooms are way smaller than you think: the door nearly touches the bed when you open it. The AC keeps turning off, the bathroom is outdated and shower doesn’t have a door, so the floor gets pretty wet. They didn’t change our sheets once, they just made the bed. Also they kept bringing fresh towels, while not taking old towels away. I was using my own towel, so I had about 8 fresh towels laying around, truly didn’t understand why they kept bringing new ones. Finally, and probably most annoying, breakfast is not in the hotel itself. You have to cross the road and walk about 20m until you reach the breakfast place, which is connected to another hotel. Its very small and the breakfast is not good. Food that’s supposed to be hot was cold, and overall not much choice. Do not go here!!"

So when I came into the room it was so tiny and dirty,even they didn't put any brush or cotton like 3 stars hotel.2 bottes in bathroom no label at all and I didn't know what is that.🥲The second thing you had to walk out around 300m to have breakfast to another place.And in the morning when I get out,the staff said one more time I have to pay for the room after breakfast.It'so weird.And the third thing when I went back to the room,they still fix or remodel some room around and it was so noisy.Not worsted for the value with the room so bad like that🙃 I booked in Booking 3 times already but when I came to the place it was totally different with the photos they show on their apps.Definitely I think I would never come back to Booking again",No

We had to put the actual address in and ask the grab driver to drop us at this location. Upon arrival you instantly realise it’s nothing like the pictures. We were greeted with a smile and checked in to our room which was a queen room with a window. The room was like a uk b&b from the 1970s tatty run down and certainly nothing like the pictures. The bathroom was dirty the window didn’t close properly so the outside noise was constant. The floor was covered in grit as they’re doing some building work but don’t clear up after. One curtain was missing so across the road has a view in night and day. You get a kettle but no cups only a glass which is a water glass not for hot water. The tv didn’t function. Breakfast is down the road at a Thai bistro that is part of another hotel so the reception give you a voucher and you walk down the road about 50 metres. Breakfast is good but the hotel should be a two star at very best. The pictures I’ve posted show the bathroom shower door the window and the wall in the room. The stair bannister was like that for the two days we stayed. On a good note the air con was good.

Мы были вынуждены соорудить «защитный барьер» из подручных средств. Без кондиционера была духота и влажность. При этом само состояние кондиционера оставляло желать лучшего, был сломан корпус.

Siarhei,Belarus,1.0,"К сожалению, ничего. Расположение, к слову, тоже.","Плохо ВСЕ и плюсов то обозначить никаких нельзя. Начиная с регистрации в отеле начали предлагать замену номера на номер с окном, кто предполагал, что в номере за 30 долларов его просто не будет...

Все старенькое, номера без ремонта, шумные кондиционеры, ОЧЕНЬ старая сантехника, печальная ванная комната, но все было в номере по стандарту. 

На первый взгляд НЕ очень чистые полы, отель нуждается в конкретной реновации, ФОТОГРАФИИ НЕ СООТВЕТСТВУЮТ РЕАЛЬНОСТИ. Из-за отсутствия окна, ощущение, что ты в хлеву в пространстве 2 на 3.

Медленный персонал, невнимательный, полагаю, уборка в номерах работает также.
Однозначно, не выберу этот отель для последующих поездок."

Ook leken de foto’s totaal niet op de hoe het in het echt eruit zag. Ook heet het hotel heel anders dan op de website 

Tijdens het verblijf werd er verbouwd, wat gedurende de dag voor geluidsoverlast zorgden. Ook zat alles onder het stof en konden we de trap niet gebruiken. Dit was erg lastig omdat de lift ook niet top was. 

Toen we op onze laatste dag onze spullen neerzetten zodat we die later konden ophalen, zat alles onder het stof. Heel vies dus.

La realidad es que este hotel con el nombre que pone booking no existe. El hotel donde nos alojaron se llama APEC y está en reforma. Nuestra habitación estaba en cuarta planta, interior, olía mal, en los paredes había moho. Al final nos quedamos ya que nos sirvió sólo para dormir, pero ha sido la peor experiencia durante todo el viaje por Vietnam. Se oyen ruidos de la reforma, todo el pasillo y el ascensor está sucio. El desayuno se sirve en otro sitio y no es una gran cosa.

Ensuite on veut nous faire choisir une chambre plus chere , en montrant des chambres meme pas faite.
Finalement quand on check in ils n’ont plus la chambre qui avait ete proposé et booké, donc upgrade gratuit. Mais a quel prix. 
Placé au dernier etage. Un etage non finit de l’hotel.
Travaux assourdissant jusqu’à 23h, odeur de peinture, poussière partout. Un enfer pour le repos. 
Le lendemain matin, suprise avec le petit-déjeuné compris. Il faut traverser la rue et aller chez le concurrent d’en face pour manger. 
Deuxième surprise ca n’est pas 6am-10 am comme expliqué la veille mais 6am 9am
Donc en arrivant on nous a mechament demander de partir. 
Au retour on me demande de payer mes 3 nuits. 
J’explique a l’hotel que par flexibilité je prefere payer le dernier jour car ensuite on part du vietnam et donc nous ne voulons pas avoir trop de monnaie locale hors du vietnam. L’equipe accepte.
Le soir, une autre personne me demande de payer.
J’explique que l’on ma validé le midi que c’etait ok. Ils insistent, disent que leurs collègues sont nuls et qu’il faut payer maintenant sinon il coupe le courant. Alors la je n’ai jamais entendu ca de ma vie. Ils parlent de booking policies l’indiquant ce qui est totalement faux.
Je remonte dans ma chambre me doucher et il toc pendant toute ma douche. Ma copine ouvre. Il l’a menace de couper le courant d’ici 20min si on paye pas, il veut bien etre flex et me faire payer 2 nuits et on fera la derniere en cash le dernier jour.
Je redescends et un employé me demande donc de payer. Les 3 nuits.
Je reexplique qu’on m’a accordé une flexibilité, il n’en demord pas, je perd patience et retire au atm de quoi payer.
Ma copine etait stressée tout le reste du sejour, et les travaux non pas cessé d’exister et de nous ennuyer.

Darauf angesprochen wurde uns erklärt, auf den Bildern seien ja schließlich auch keine Fenster zu sehen gewesen. Die Bilder in der Beschreibung entsprechen insgesamt nicht der Realität. 
Der Abflussgeruch war stark, im zweiten gebuchten Zimmer roch es  ausgeprägt nach Baustaub und nachts störte lautes Brummen wie von Pumpen den Schlaf.
Das Frühstück wurde durch ein anderes Hotel ein paar Häuser weiter gestellt, das scheinbar mehrere Hotels versorgte. Der Raum war entsprechend sehr eng und voll. Die Frühstückauswahl war für Vegetarier sehr gering.
Das Gepäck konnte zwar gelagert werden bis zur Abreise, allerdings in einem Baulager, entsprechend zementstaubverdreckt war es."

The breakfast was very very poor, not enough to meet the stomach, very small variety of food, very disappointed. The food was not refrigerated such as the orange juice, the milk, the fruits, the small salad so it was hot and not tasty....
Although its location has a great view, the chairs were not comfortable, the tables too high.

You will hear everytime someone opens a door from your floor, the floor above and bellow.Tried to close it slowly but it does an infernal noise( and if you will be “lucky” enough to have neighboors that close the door 50 times in 30 mins at 1am(because the people don’t care and they think they are the only ones there) it will be a nightmare.
Also the rooms are similar with the pictures(the images are from the project phase).
The terrace looks horror
And by the way, the bus to the airport is at 10 mins walk on street Tran Hung Dao(even if the reception staff says that they don’t know where it is) and it costs 20k inclusing the luggages( for 2 person,2 luggages).-it takes 30 mins to arrive at the airport"

It is not called as advertised!! Plus one particular unhelpful, overwhelmed receptionist made the stay interesting. We had the shower flooding in our room, spent 30 minutes at reception trying to explain and translating the issue for her, just to be reassured someone is coming in 30 minutes. No one did, we had to clear the dirt scum that was blocking the drain. Therefore fixing it ourselves in the end. Great location to be fair, but so are so many other hotels in district 1. Super basic breakfast. The rate when there seemed to be lower than what we paid through booking.com. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.",

FInaly the toilet was like a geyser when someone else upstairs was using its own. Therefore i had to put a towel on top to prevent the water to go everywhere... I am surprised booking allow them to book rooms, the hotel just does not exist.

Helpful staff.
Located well in 1st district at the street with many local designer shops.","When arrived, no hotel name or logo outside. Originally we booked room with window (it was written city view) when we made booking. As our flight was late and we arrived around midnight the reception mentioned that they sold our room already and there is only 1 room type available. The room had a window, but it was facing the wall, so no sunlight during the day in the room at all. We knew it is specific for HCM hotels, that's why we booked room category with window and city view, which we couldn't get. furthermore, as room was located on the 1st floor,  sounds from outside AC were very loud, together with mini fridge and in room AC sound.  It was very late, there was no other rooms available for upgrade, so we went to rest first. Next day when we woke up we saw bathroom was ""attacked"" by ants. That's why we decided not to stay for the second night. The reception was very understanding, she didn't charge for the second night cancellation fee."

Tabea,Đức,3.0,Der Wasserdruck in der Dusche ist sehr gut. Die Temperatur lässt sich gut regulieren.,"Kurz zusammengefasst: das Hotel wirbt mit falschen Bildern und Vorstellungen, die guten Bewertungen sind gekauft! Schaut genau hin - zwei Bewertungen aus April sind komplett identisch. 
Hotel an sich existiert garnicht - es heißt Matterhorn (Bewertungen bei Google sprechen Bände) 
Innenhof - existiert nicht 
Rooftopbar - grausam 

Für mich war das ein absoluter Höllentrip - der bereits mit der Anreise begann. Da das Hotel von außen komplett anders aussieht als auf den Fotos UND ein anderer Name am Hotel stand war ich verdutzt, als mich mein Fahrer dort nun absetze. Nachdem ich das Hotel also nicht finden konnte vermutete ich dieses aufgrund von Apple Karten wo anders und machte mich eine Stunde lang samt Koffer und Rucksack bei 35 Grad auf die Suche. 
Nachdem ich feststellte, dass es doch dieses Etablissement sein musste ging ich hinein und wurde von der Klimaanlage begrüßt. Sie tropft, extrem. Als zweites begrüßte mich eine Kakerlake - leider hatte ich da bereits gezahlt. Der ganze Eingangsbereich sowie das Treppenhaus stinken extrem. 
Das Zimmer sah auch nicht aus wie auf den Fotos, extrem in die Jahre gekommen und von dem Bad will ich garnicht erst anfangen.  Auf meinem Bettbezug waren Flecken. Zudem hatte ich eine lange Ameisenstraße an der Wand, ein paar haben so leider auch den Weg in meinen Koffer gefunden, gleichwohl das Personal versucht hat die Tiere zu entfernen. 

Ich empfehle dem Hotel die FAKE Bilder hier durch echte Bilder zu ersetzen und den Preis dementsprechend nach unten zu schrauben. Dann würde es auch nicht so viele echte Negativbewertungen geben, weil die Ansprüche garnicht erst so hoch wären. 

Und an die Gäste: bucht was anderes."
Assia,Pháp,2.0,Rien,"Nous avons séjourné dans cet hôtel pour 1 nuit.
La réceptionniste nous a gentiment reçus pour le check-in. Nous avions réservé une chambre standard sans fenêtre (pour éviter les bruits extérieurs). On nous a attribué une chambre avec vue sur la rue au 1er étage (donc exposée aux bruits de circulation et klaxons) et nous avons demandé a être a un étage supérieur pour le même type de chambre mais on nous demandais un supplément.
Nous avons finalement obtenu la chambre sans fenêtre, mais il faut savoir qu'il n'y a pas de ventilation mais juste une clim: une horreur !!!

Le matin, nous avons été reveillés par les bruits des canalisations des autres chambres qui passent dans les murs.
L'isolation est très mauvaise et on entend absolument tout ce qu'il se passe dans le couloir.

Nous ne vous recommandons pas cet établissement. Si vous séjournez à Ho Chi Minh ville, passez votre chemin !"
Carla,Pháp,1.0,Rien nous sommes arrivés à minuit après avoir prévenu que notre vol avait eu 2h de retard. On nous informe à l’arrivée qu’en fait l’hôtel n’a plus aucune chambre de disponible.,Terrible. Nous arrivons tard le soir après un têtard de vol. Nous avons prévenu l’hôtel avec qui nous avions déjà bien reçu la confirmation via booking etc que nous arriverons plus tard. Et arrivées sur place ils nous informent qu’il n’y a plus de chambre disponible. Méfiez vous !
Simon,Đức,1.0,"Nichts, Das Hotel ist 100% Betrug","Das Hotel ist 100% Betrug und ich würde jedem raten nicht darauf reinzufallen. Hier die Gründe:
1. Die Ortsmarkierung auf der Booking-Karte ist anders als die tatsächliche Adresse, daher existiert das Hotel auch nicht an dem richtigen Ort auf Google-Maps, was mir leider erst im Taxi aufgefallen ist. 
2. Das Hotel sieht keinesfalls aus, wie auf den Fotos, sondern ist sehr alt und keinesfalls so modern. Die Dachterrasse und einen grünen Innenhof gibt es nicht. 
3. Als ich ankam, war alles zunächst okay. Als ich jedoch zunächst das Zimmer sehen wollte, war meine Reservierung plötzlich verschwunden und kein Zimmer mehr frei, obwohl ich direkt zuvor per WhatsApp Kontakt zum Hotel hatte und alles gut schien. 
4. Direkt wurde mir ein befreundetes Hotel nebenan empfohlen, dies habe ich jedoch abgelehnt, da auf meine Beschwerden, dass die Adresse falsch ist, Google Bewertung (1,2) Beschwerden vorliegen, falsche Fotos und plötzliche Stornierung…Alles ist eine Betrugsmasche, da anscheinend mittlerweile der Besitzer gewechselt hat und nur noch Touristen betrügen will.

Dominik,Đức,4.0,Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption waren bemüht und freundlich. Die Lage der Unterkunft war für uns in Ordnung.,"Das Hotel ist nicht einfach zu finden, da die Beschilderung an der Außenfassade nicht mit dem hier genannten Namen übereinstimmt. 
Leider riecht es in der gesamten Unterkunft modrig - vor allem in den Badezimmern, da es keine Lüftungsanlage gibt. Die Klimaanlage tropft zwar, aber kühlt immerhin.
Die Mitarbeiterin am Frühstücksbuffet war unmotiviert und das Frühstücksbuffet (wenn man es so nennen möchte?!) war sehr überschaubar. Außerdem lag eine tote Kakerlake mitten auf der Terrasse. 
Auch im Zimmer lies die Sauberkeit zu wünschen übrig. Es lagen (auch nach dem „Room Service) ein (nicht von uns) gebrauchtes Wattestäbchen, Haare und Dreck herum. Außerdem waren die Möbel (vor allem im Bad) sehr abgenutzt und heruntergekommen.
Der Straßenverkehr ist nicht zu überhören & die „Wände“ bestehen gefühlt aus Zeitungspapier.

Wir würden diese Unterkunft absolut nicht weiterempfehlen. Die Bilder versprechen viel mehr als das, was man letztendlich bekommt. Preis-/ Leistung stimmt hier leider nicht."

2. Название в жизни не то, что указано на букинге. Были удивлены, 9 вечера, мы после сложного перелета с ребенком, а вывески с названием Grand Horn нет. По указанному адресу был всего 1 отель, на ресепшене выяснилось что это он есть
3. Не совсем понятно, зачем предлагать завтраки, если их негде расположить: небольшая комнатка на крыше, половина из которой занята кухней, с обеда используется как бар. Сесть было негде, пройти негде, барные стулья были заняты. Круассаны, тосты, суп и спагетти. Попросили приготовить омлет. Кофе/чай надо просить."

Sergey,Đức,7.0,"Location is top, though it's not very easy to find, as the name on the door is not La Sonata, but ""smth else Sonata"", and google maps show the hotel as the entrance is not from the main street, although it is. The room is as in the pictures. 
Breakfast is ok, but not a lot of choice and frankly there was almost nothing to eat for me apart from fruits, which were good.","The check-in and check-out procedures were unnecessarily long and with suggestions to upgrade the room for money, and what was most embarassing, that we could not leave the hotel before they ""check the room""...
The floor in the room was very dirty, it wasn't washed properly for ages. 
The elevators are horrible. In order to get to 4th floor we had to take one elevator, then go stairs down and take another elevator. Elevators are tiny, so one can hardly fit there with suitcases."

I have a strong feeling that the originally booked room was, in fact, available, but there was an attempt to charge tourists extra. Unfortunately, this left us with a somewhat unpleasant impression."

Did express laundry and expected them in 5hrs as told but did not receive them . Informed the front desk and they expedite it for me and received it an hour or so later.   

Probably some miscommunication with them and laundry shop .

Was staying at level 1 and there are always commotions outside the front desk late night from time to time with unruly customers complaining etc etc 

The management should really look into adding more male manpower , especially at night , and not leave a young female front desk to deal with those unruly people .

Sympathise the front desk lady that has to deal with those loud and disrespectful idiots raising their voices at her and disrupting my rest too ..

Management should really look into these .

We enjoyed the proximity to points of interest in Ho Chin Minh (Saigon).","ALWAYS BE WEARY OF HOTELS THROUGH BOOKING.COM INDICATING NO CANCELLATION !
As I wrote to booking.com the first day we arrived and never received any return mail from them. The hotel pictures were misleading. I use these in part to decide if I would like to rent the hotel 9as many due i am cetain), for example the sink was cracked in 3 places, the wall paper peeling off not just on one section but every section were a wall paper joint was present, the shower was moldy and didnt drain properly causing flooding every time we took a shower. Geez there was even a drain pipe for the AC coming through the wall into the floor in the bathroom. The heat in Ho Chin Minh during the day was 35 to 37 celsius with humidity 42 to 44 celsius, the window didn't close properly making it difficult to impossible for the room to cool properly, the AC was old and didn't emit varying fan speed, the bed cover was dirty when we arrived. The repair man of the hotel came paid us lip service indicated he couldnt fix the items mentioned above and bid us good nigth.... I wrote to booking.com and never received to this day a return email from them. Furthermore, on the following day there was a group of 8 to 12 people in the lobby most of the afternoon, quite upset and raising their voice with the reception staff. When I inquired I found out they were all being asked to pay a surcharge which was double and half what they had paid during their reservation which occurred a month previously. Booking.com rates this hotel 8.5 hahaha what a joke. As they well know customers really on their services to ensure hotels are appropriate, support their customers when trouble occur.... if they cant do that, why should I be using booking.com's services anyway?? It seems to be a case were they chose to align with the renters rather then supports their customers. To me this is a fatal mistake on their part. Guess you got the answer to am I ever going to use booking.com to book hotels in the future."

The next day, a new receptionist they said that they only checked a small part of the CCTV footage, and refuse to give us a clear reason why. She also didn’t know that there was a security check yesterday, which means they have been lying. And refuse to give a refund since it’s not part of ‘hotel policy’.

The breakfast was horrible, possibly the worst meal we had in Vietnam. The milk and fruit was covered with flies and the “hot” food was cold.

Catherine,Vương Quốc Anh,3.0,The aircon works well and the shower is nice.,"On arrival I was strongly pressured to pay an extra 300,000 dong to “upgrade my room” because the one I had booked “was very small and has no window” - I stupidly said yes but on reading previous reviews it appears they’ve said this to multiple people and then provided them with the same room. There was then a further delay at check in where I had to sit and wait. When I checked in for some reason they explained (very clearly!) that I would be charged if I smoked in the room or damaged anything, but didn’t bother to explain anything else such as whether breakfast was available. 

The actual room was not good - the window was covered in tape and not correctly fitted so couldn’t be closed all the way. This meant there was road noise all the time. The bed sheets are really weird, they’re just sort of laid on top of the mattress so the second you roll over the bare mattress is exposed. Cleaning staff let themselves into my room at 8.30am on the first day despite the “do not disturb” sign being on my door. 

There’s supposed to be a spa, wellness centre and hot tub - I saw no evidence of this at any stage. 

There was then a delay at check-out as the receptionist insisted she needed to “check my room” (that’s the first time a hotel has ever wanted to do that on the whole trip - and my room was fine) and wouldn’t allow me to leave until this was done even though I explained I need to catch a bus. 

I think there is something weird going on at this hotel. It certainly isn’t what is advertised on booking.com. Please avoid staying here!"
Laurent-pierre,Pháp,2.0,"The location of this hotel is good. The breakfast is rather good. But the the staff was not really friendly, they just did the minimum. Our sink leaked a lot, which caused a big puddle in the bathroom every time, which was very annoying to use the toilet. And last but not least, they do not have storage luggage. This small hotel simply has no place to give anything extra, there is not even a shared toilet, which is simply not acceptable for a hotel. At check-out we were not alone as a customer to leave our luggage for a few hours. With 3 other strange couples we really had to beg several times even loudly to leave our luggage with them for a few hours before we left Saigon to go to the airport (flight in the late afternoon). After one of the customers threatened with the police, they finally agreed to store our luggage in another hotel nearby. I am not satisfied with this hotel and would therefore not recommend it.",

When we reported the leak, no one offered to move us. A plumber came, fixed it temporarily, left a mess - and no one cleaned up. We had to ask several times just to get clean towels.

The next morning, that manager refused us breakfast, saying it was only included with the “upgrade” and not part of our original booking. She asked for proof, but the hotel’s booking confirmation had barely any info — even Booking.com support found that unacceptable.

She showed no empathy or professionalism. The hotel is dirty overall, even in the lobby. If you have any issues, don’t expect help. We won’t return.",

Whether it was intentional or just disorganized, it didn’t leave a good impression.

Staff weren’t helpful beyond that either — no assistance with tours, no recommendations unless asked directly, and even then, they seemed annoyed. There was just no effort to be welcoming or accommodating.

The room itself was fine, nothing special, but definitely overpriced for what it was. Breakfast was super simple — don’t expect anything beyond the basics. Also, my room was in a separate building, and to get to it I had to take one lift to a certain floor, then transfer to a different lift in another part of the building. Just unnecessarily inconvenient, especially if you don’t want to be moving around a lot.

Only real plus was the location. Overall, a disappointing experience that I wouldn’t repeat.",

Dann merkt man erst an der fehlenden Reaktion, dass sie es nicht verstanden haben und man muss lernen, Gesichter zu lesen. Das nervt auf Dauer. Roomservice gab es unregelmäßig, manchmal schlampig (Handtücher aufs Bett geworfen, kein Toilettenpapier), manchmal ordentlich. Der Boden wurde nie gereinigt, nach 4 Tagen ist das unangenehm. Kakerlaken kommen durch Schlitze zwischen Wand und Decke, wir hatten eine im Bad sitzen aber die gibt es vermutlich überall. Das Bett war frisch bezogen, das Kissen darin hätte auch eine Wäsche nötig, es hat nach fettigen Haaren gerochen. Die Klimaanlage stank nach Schimmel und hat getropft. Wir haben es hier trotzdem eine Woche ausgehalten, es ist in Ordnung aber den Preis nicht wert. Beim Check-in wurden uns 300.000 abgeknöpft, weil wir früher rein wollten. Ein anderes Zimmer (Upgrade) haben sie uns aber mit Aufpreis angeboten, dort hätten wir aber nicht für den Early-Check-in bezahlen müssen. Beide Zimmer waren aber Bezugsbereit, wir haben beide besichtigt und durften uns dann eins aussuchen. Das war ziemlich random… und die Diskussionen über die Sinnlosigkeit waren nach 14 Stunden Flug und mit Google Translatior einfach Sau nervig."

- Die Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet
- Das Personal half beim Koffertragen und es gab ein Begrüßungsgetränk","- Bei meiner Ankunft wurde versucht mir direkt ein teureres Zimmer als das gebuchte zu verkaufen, mit einem Sonderrabatt. Als ich darauf nicht einging, teilte man mir mit, dass mein gebuchtes Zimmer nicht verfügbar wäre und quartierte mich zunächst in ein besseres Zimmer ein. Es wurde also versucht mich hinters Licht zu führen! Das bessere Zimmer musste ich jedoch trotz meines nur zweitägigen Aufenthaltes am nächsten Tag wieder verlassen und sozusagen umziehen. Das Personal war dahingehend sehr penetrant. Das neue Zimmer hatte ein defektes Waschbecken und das Bett war so hart, dass mir am Folgetag der Rücken wehtat. Das Frühstück ist sehr mäßig, es gibt kaum Auswahl und gegen Ende ist alles ausgesucht. Darüber hinaus benötigt man eine Art Gutschein für das Frühstück, der mir beim Einchecken nicht gegeben wurde und so wurde ich beim Frühstück massiv belästigt und sollte mir den Gutschein erst besorgen, bevor ich frühstücken kann.

Raymond,Úc,8.0,"Stay was pleasant, Hanna was very helpful throughout the whole stay. 1 room smelt of cigarettes, and the bathrooms were a bit smaller than expected, but for what we paid it was a good place to stay and run out of as a base to do what we wanted.",
Tu,Việt Nam,8.0,"The room is privacy and easy to enter. Room is spacious enough and have all facilities needed. Bed was soft and comfy however it is Queen size not king size . Location is just great, next to the Oink Church and surrounding with many local restaurants and fancy as well. Easy for shopping. Bike parking is easy and free. Generally its worthy’s for what u paid.",The bathroom is very small! Check in was not really smooth because that time the receptionist was empty so we have to wait for sometime. However the HK lady is very helpful and kind. So she helped us with the check in. They not offer room clean and change towels if you stay more than 4 nights. Even we stayed for 3 nights we had to sweep our room by ourselves!
Truong,Úc,8.0,Friend service and the location.,
Nthato,Nam Phi,9.0,"Great value for money. The space was clean and comfortable. Great for a long stay, there are good restaurants around as well.",
Timmy,Mỹ,9.0,Room was spacious and clean had all amenities you would need in an apartment. Free laundry and cleaning service (upon request) were great addition. Price point was great and all staff especially Huong were friendly!,
Carlay,Mỹ,7.0,"The place was really close to street food eateries. Literally, a 1 minute walk away. The cleaning lady was really nice and accommodating. Bonus points to her!",The hot water and water pressure in the shower wasn't consistent. Other than that everything else was good.
Danilo,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"A very decent apartment good for family in a small neighborhood, can be busy during the day but quiet overnight. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, even allowed us to check in early and showed us everything that we needed. There is a 24/7 convenient store just outside the property complex which was very helpful as you can buy food and drink anytime if needed. There is a few cafes and shops nearby for some good drinks and shopping.",A very minor and negligible but I wished the shower was placed better.
Durven,Vương Quốc Anh,8.0,In a discrete location,That I had a room right next to the lift
Duong,Úc,9.0,"Great location, Tan Đình market is nearby. Food and other necessities are within five minute walking.
Dedicated host. Hannah’s prompt and professional service.
Quiet room, very comfy bed, clean room, fast lift.","Room size is right for one person, a bit small for two.
Lack of instructions in how to use items in the apartment (microwave, hot plate, safe)

Japhy,Vương Quốc Anh,7.0,"nice design, location and is kept very clean. Han is very friendly and attentive.","Although the price is decent comparatively to other locations in town, It was not clear before I booked that I was to pay electric on top of my booking fee (anything for more than 28 days). 

They told me this only when I arrived to stay - which was seemingly not fair to the customer who depends on the location to be available at the price as described as booked in advance

I (rightly) reported this scenario to booking.com the host was angry and threatened to terminate my stay. That was not fair to me. I hope they clearly state the booking terms on the listing to avoid further such issues. 

The building is decent but, is quite old now (from the 80's / 90's) and needs renovation / renewal in my opinion. It also has ants everywhere.

Overall I was happy to stay there - and pay the electric fee (another 1M + a month) however I feel they handled this issue poorly."
Ricky,Singapore,9.0,It was a new hotel (1 month old) and the owners were very enthusiastic about receiving guests. The location was central with lots of good food and shopping around.,I stayed there for 3 nights and my room was not cleaned once. I could have asked but decided to leave it. The staff was still new and things were not too organized yet. But you can see the effort.
Jennifer,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"The location to the centre was about a 15 minutes leisurely walk, with plenty of shops and places to eat around you.  security at the reception/door entrance at night and house keeper in the property through the day. the property is well maintained, the housekeeper does a good job doing your laundry and keeping the apartment clean and the outside area clean.
 the bed is  extra comfortable and the mattress was clean and the bedding felt good including pillows. I would rate the bed 10 out of 10.",small little details miss at check out clean like finger prints around shower doors and fridge
Anna,Nga,9.0,"Very nice two-bedrooms apartment! A lot of space, very bright and well equipped. The owner is always ready to answer your questions by WhatsApp and there is some staff in the htel to help you. Thay also did our laundry for free (and we had a lot of clothes to clean).

Arttu,Phần Lan,9.0,"Good spot to explore Tan Dinh area of Saigon.
I personally liked the accommodation and would've stayed longer, but they were fully booked except for the rooms in ground floor which did not seem as comfortable.

Rustig in een steeg, maar na 500 m lopen ben je in de drukke Tan Dinh Markt (naast de Roze kerk). Overal genoeg eetkraampjes. Een kleine mini mart voor de deur is erg handig voor als je extra water wilt of hygiene producten nodig hebt.

Andrea,Đức,1.0,Gute Lage im Stadtbezirk 1.,"Leider hat die Unterkunft gar nichts mit dem zu tun, was auf den Bildern zu sehen ist. Wie haben das „Deluxe“ Zimmer gebucht, wo von Deluxe gar nichts zu sehen war. Die Bilder sind extrem geschönt und das Zimmer ist nicht zu erkennen. Statt einem netten beigen Sofa steht dort eine vergilbte Plastikcouch, der Kabelsalat inklusive Router unversteckt mitten an der Wand. In der Dusche kriecht der Schimmel überall hoch, beim Waschbecken hat man Angst, dass es bei einer Berührung von der Wand kracht. Im Zimmer stehen Flipflops für die Gäste, die sehr offensichtlich bereits getragen waren, und auch der Küchenlumpen hing noch feucht und fleckig an der Spüle. Überall ist es dreckig und zu allem Überdruss drückt es den Abwassergestank so schlimm aus der Dusche, dass man nachts nicht schlafen kann. Es gab einen Safe (Pluspunkt), dieser ist aber gar nicht am Strom angeschlossen und funktioniert nicht (direkt wieder Minuspunkt). Stadtblick ist ein Blick auf die Hausmauer nebenan.

24/7 Rezeption ist ein Mann, der einfach dort auf einer Couch hinter dem Tresen, sein Nachtlager aufgeschlagen hat. Dieser spricht kein Wort englisch. Mit der Besitzerin kann man gut über Whats App kommunizieren, wir haben ihr auch all unsere Probleme mitgeteilt, geändert wurde leider gar nichts. Sie wollte uns etwas vom Preis erlassen, abgerechnet wurde jedoch am Ende voll.

Bucht auf gar keinen Fall, vor allem nicht zu diesem Preis!"

Housekeeping was done daily, and the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming. They went out of their way to answer all our questions and assist us whenever needed.

The location is excellent—most of the main attractions and nightlife spots are within walking distance, making it super convenient. Even when we used Grab (similar to Uber), the travel time and cost were both very reasonable.

We just returned from an amazing 5-night stay here during our Ho Chi Minh City trip, and we have no complaints at all. As mentioned—we got more than we paid for.

I have been charged twice. They cancel reservations of everyone. I've seen their display at reception: almost all reservations are red (they cancelled). They cancel at the day you come, then they ask you to pay, and then they charge you second time with no-show Booking policy. Also they ask you to sign agreement on their form, I've signed it and I've seen other people who also sign it. Usually when you book at Booking hotels don't ask for this.

Please if you also been scammed demand from Booking, Agoda etc to return you money and demand to remove their hotel from service. It's not first time for them to be removed, previously they called Cat Hotel back in 2019 (check out Street View). They definitely will create new profile on service to scam more people."

They gave us a smaller room than was photographed in the pictures. I also heard someone else complain about this whilst I was there. 
I also had to complain as I was woken up at 6am the first two nights due to staff in the reception talking loudly and laughing. Once I messaged them, this did stop so staff did respond well. However it shows that the walls are quite thin. 

Our room was also the only one on the same floor as reception, and you'd have to walk past the staff toilet to get to it which wasn't pleasant."

-the floor was never swept in nearly a week and the shower plug was full of hair and dirt since before we were there. The shower wouldn’t drain properly.
-we were moved to a “better room” which we paid more for, with air con but it didn’t work properly and got very warm every night. Then was accused at the end of the week for not paying for the full amount but was never shown proof of this. The booking.com receipt and the card receipt prices didn’t match- we paid more.
-noise every morning like there was a building site next door between 7-8am."
Claire,Vương Quốc Anh,3.0,Good location,"The property is nowhere near as modern and trendy as the pictures show. It is a lot more rundown and less spacious.

We brought this to the attention of the reception staff and asked them to ensure it was cleaned. When we returned that evening we were very disappointed to find it in basically the same condition… floor unhoovered, shower still dirty etc."

Jeerawat,Thái Lan,10.0,พนักงานต้อนรับน่ารักสุดๆ ดูแลดีและช่วยเหลือตลอด พนักงานยกกระเป๋าก็บริการเยี่ยมมาก ทำให้รู้สึกสบายใจตั้งแต่มาถึง ทำเลของโรงแรมก็ดีมาก อยู่กลางเมือง เดินทางไปทำงานสะดวกสุดๆ,แต่แอบรู้สึกว่าผนังห้องเก็บเสียงไม่ค่อยดีเท่าไหร่ค่ะ บางทีได้ยินเสียงจากห้องข้างๆ แต่ก็ไม่ได้รบกวนมากจนเกินไป โดยรวมถือว่าดีมากค่ะ แนะนำเลย!
Noelle,Đức,6.0,Die Unterkunft ist sehr zentral gelegen und daher super praktisch um viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß zu erreichen!,"Es waren sehr viele Ameisen im Zimmer, die wir leider erst entdeckt haben nachdem sie in unsere Tasche gekrabbelt sind… wir mussten dann unser gesamtes Gepäck einmal ausräumen und ausschütteln. Außerdem wurden wir zu einem Upgrade gedrängt… wir hatten eigentlich ein einfaches Doppelzimmer gebucht, welches dann aber nach unserm Verständnis nicht verfügbar war. Wir wurden dann auf ein Familienzimmer upgegraded. Die erste Nacht mussten wir dafür nicht mehr zahlen, aber für die nächsten zwei Nächte wurde uns dann gesagt, wir sollten einfach 200.000 VND mehr zahlen. Auf die Frage, was mit unserem gebuchten Zimmer ist, wurde nie wirklich geantwortet."

Xem mãi mới dám đặt vì ksan mới toanh vừa mới lên booking xong chẳng có 1 cái đánh giá nào cả, phòng đẹp mà giá lại ngang với cái phòng bé tẹo mình vừa huỷ nên đánh liều đặt. À lại còn vừa đặt 1 ksan mới nhưng ngta gọi báo huỷ do hệ thống lỗi chứ, đi quanh ấy thì đâu cũng cháy phòng do là valungtung 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️ đặt xong nơm nớp chạy qua đó cách chỗ mình đứng có 800m. Đi gần tới nơi thì hơi ngợp, nhìn như cái biệt thự :)) lại đối diện Mrt với chợ Bến Thành. Đi lên thì có chú trực ca ra mở cửa luôn, nói chuyện nhẹ nhàng, hỗ trợ mình nhận phòng nhanh lắm, chú còn đi gửi xe giúp bạn mình luôn do hầm để xe privat. Lúc nhận thẻ tranh thủ ngó sảnh thì nó mới toanh, style rất có gu và đẹp lại ko quá cầu kỳ mà vẫn sang. Lên tới phòng mở ra 2 đứa ngơ luôn vì phòng to quá 🥹🥹🥹 lúc đó mừng lắm vì biết là bốc trúng si cờ rịt rồi :)) phòng đẹp có bếp có tủ lạnh, cái tv còn nguyên seal chứ :))) nhà wc to đẹp, điều hoà âm trần sịn sò luôn, nói chung mọi thứ đều mới tinh và sạch sẽ. Mình ở 3 ngày, ngày hay đêm lúc nào cũng có người trực, họ thấy mình đi lên là sẽ mở cửa dùm, rất niềm nở. Các bạn nhân viên cũng thân thiện, ngày nào mình ngủ tới trưa sẽ chủ động để trước cửa 2 chai nước lọc chứ ko làm phiền, thấy mình đi ra ngoài sẽ hỏi được dọn phòng không. Ở tới bữa thứ hai rảnh nói chuyện mới biết chỗ này mới mở, do cityhouse quản lý, vừa lên booking luôn và mình may mắn book ngay lúc ưu đãi đó. Sau 3 ngày thì mình hoàn toàn hài lòng với trải nghiệm ở đây,mọi thứ đều 100 điểm từ không gian, thái độ phục vụ, phòng ốc, vị trí địa lý cũng ngay giữa trung tâm, mức giá lại hoàn toàn hợp lý. Rất recommend mn tới đây trải nghiệm ạ 🥰🥰",

The room I had was very large. The bed was 5 star quality. The shower was amazing!! They give you water every day. There is tea, coffee, a fridge/ freezer and a small kitchen area too. 

Did I mention the shower!!!! It was the only thing I took a picture of as I want to try to find one back home!!!! 😮

I had friends travelling with me who stayed in a different hotel and they could not believe the difference from their hotel (which they paid more for!!). Do not look any further, this is the place to stay in district 1.

The Metro is 3 minute walk. There is a massive market 2 minute walk away that sells everything, and I mean everything: watches, bags, clothes, trainers, food, souvenirs, etc. you can even get a suit made in 24 hours.",Genuinely I could not pick any fault here.

Matan,Canada,1.0,The location was good,"I booked “Luxury Mays Hotel” but the actual place has two different names (The Dilly) and was a huge disappointment. The rooms looked nothing like the photos — they were half-renovated, with unfinished walls and exposed wiring. It felt more like a construction zone than a hotel.

Make sure you see the room before you pay, we had to go through 3 rooms until we found something decent.

Service was poor, and staff seemed disinterested. To make things worse, the price was ridiculously high for what was offered. Most of the glowing reviews appear to be fake or copied — don’t be misled like I was.

Save your money and look elsewhere."
Teressa,Pháp,1.0,The location,"The scam of the photos  that are not at all conform to the rooms. 
Many rooms have fake that look like real  in the photos. We saw six rooms and each room was worse than the other."
Phuong,Úc,3.0,Cant think of anything from that hotel,Everything
Duong,Việt Nam,1.0,Nothing.,"The price is very compare to the service. 
- Staffs is clumsy and not helpful. When customer complain , they blame on many thing thay out of their hand 
- not even provide a bottle of water
- do not have any facilities.
- the room is smell and old
- the aircon doesnot work and do not any thing, while customer pay a high amount of money
- water is so dirty
- got problem with cold water in the morning, we have to use hot water for bushteeth and wc
Moreover, there is another situation that, there are a lot of booked the room 01 month advance, but when they came, staff said that they have to pay 3 times amount due to need so high so hotel can not keep the price that customer booked before. It sound like cheating.
Summarize, we feel that we got cheat. And advice not come this hotel, otherwise you feel frustrate and annoy."
Jiří,Cộng hoà Séc,2.0,Nothing,During the check in we got the room that we did not ordered. The room was terrible - dirty and mold everywhere. After the claim we got better room but again the photos that are on the booking are not in correlation with reality.  Hotel is not in good condition. I do not understand the positive reviews on the booking which are public in the same time! Please see the real photos - zoom it.

Inoltre abbiamo chiesto di usare una camera per un'ora alle 16:00 dopo il tour per farci una doccia pre volo, la sera prima il costo era 100.000 dong, il pomeriggio dopo ci dicono che dobbiamo prenotarla per minimo 2 ore prezzo 300.000 dong.

Pia,Đức,4.0,,Sadly the bathroom could not really be called as such. It was terrible humid and dark. The smell of mould spread across the whole room. I preferred not to take a shower.
Anne,Philippines,10.0,"This was my first solo trip abroad, so I was very keen on selecting the hotel I stayed at. I chose this place because it’s very accessible, with food establishments and tourist destinations within walking distance. Nang, the staff member, was very helpful and catered to all my requests. She even installed a new TV when she learned that the one in my room was broken. The room was spacious, very clean, and the bed was so comfy that I had to force myself to leave my room at some point. 😅 Also, the price is super affordable.",

-unpleasant beddings and sheets, very synthetics. not comfortable

Jeremy,Mỹ,10.0,"Ben Thanh Inn is a cozy hotel with 2 rooms per floor. The check-in process at the front desk was easy and payment can be made with card or cash. The hotel is tucked away in an alley and it is a 5-10 minute walk to the famous landmarks in Saigon such as the Opera House, Nguyen Hue walking street, and Ben Thanh Market. The rooms themselves are spacious and clean with comfortable mattresses and great air conditioning. Free strong wifi is provided and I had no issues with connectivity.",
Meghna,Ấn Độ,2.0,The location is good as it is closer to all the sites in the city.,"The room felt dingy, it wasn't clean.

Jerzy,Ba Lan,10.0,"Very comfortable, spotlessly clean, great location and exceptionally helpful receptionist Zoey who got in touch with me before my arrival and was always there to answer my questions.

Yura,Nga,8.0,"Удобная кровать, быстрый интернет, питьевая вода на первос этаже, хорошо работает кондиционер и достаточно чисто в номере при заселении. Всё как на фотографиях.","Если вам дадут последний этаж, то это провал. У отеля ужасная металлическая крыша, которая ещё и протекает. Ночью невозможно спать из-за громкой музыки соседнего клуба, беруши не помогают, вибрация от крыши передаётся всей комнате, во время дождя тоже самое. 

Мне поменяли номер на следующий день, поэтому оценки ещё адекватные, но в последнюю ночь протечка с крыши дошла и до меня. Чуть не угробил ноутбук, успел убрать подальше. В других номерах в берушах спать нормально. Очень неудобный стол для работы, нет пространства для ног."
Mikhail,Việt Nam,9.0,"Отличный отель. Светлые чистые номера. Хороший персонал. Уборка по запросу. Находится в тихом переулке, недалеко от центра и рядом с рынком Бен Тань.",Интернет нужно чуть мощнее. Могут попасться номера где кондиционер дует прямо на кровать. Могут возникнуть проблемы с парковкой.
Lilo,Đức,5.0,Die Lage ist spitze. 5 Minuten zum Markt und der Innenstadt. Alles sehr nah.,"Die Disko ist so laut. Wir hatten die Rezensionen zwar vorher gelesen und wussten, dass hier eine ist, aber das war wirklich zu viel. Das bett vibriert mit dem Bass mit. Die Dusche ist direkt über der Toilette. Ständig ist alles nass. Im Bad fehlt es stark an Hygiene. Wände Schimmeln usw."
Jadekind,Đức,4.0,"- Das Personal war durchweg freundlich und hilfsbereit.
- Der Check-in und Check-out verliefen reibungslos und unkompliziert.
- Die zentrale Lage des Hotels ist ideal für Erkundungstouren in der Stadt.
- Leistungsstarke Klimaanlage","- Die Sauberkeit ließ stark zu wünschen übrig. Der Spiegel, das Zahnputzglas und der Wasserkocher hatten Flecken, dazu kamen Staubablagerungen, dreckige Ablagen im Kühlschrank.
- An der Decke waren deutliche Wasserflecken sichtbar.
- Im Badezimmer gab es Schimmel an den Fugen, einen modrigen Geruch und sogar kleine Kakerlaken.
- Eine Ameisenstraße verlief direkt hinter dem Bett an der Wand entlang.
- Auch wenn das Hotel darauf hinweist, wird im Vorfeld nicht klar, wie extrem laut die Musik vom nahegelegenen Club ist. Das Zimmer hat buchstäblich vibriert und ohne Ohrstöpsel war an Schlaf nicht zu denken.

Fazit: Leider war dies das schlechteste Hotel meiner 18-tägigen Vietnam-Reise. Beim nächsten Mal würde ich lieber etwas mehr bezahlen und eine sauberere, angenehmere Unterkunft wählen."
（新生支援）,Nhật Bản,2.0,ベンタイン市場やサイゴンバスターミナルなどからほど近く便利な場所であった,排水口が詰まっているのかシャワーの水がどんどん溜まっていき部屋に溢れそうになるのでゆっくりシャワーを浴びることができなかった。トイレとシャワーが一緒になったタイプでゴキブリがたくさん出てきた。ゴキブリだけは勘弁してもらいたい。部屋のゴミ捨てなどの清掃には入ってくれないのでゴミが溜まっていく一方。窓を開けるとすぐ隣のビルが改装中で夜中までずっとうるさかった。

Je ne comprends pas que les autres commentaires ne le mentionne pas plus que ça. Ou alors nous sommes vraiment mal tomber sur nos 2 nuits (samedi et dimanche).

Selbst auf dem Bett. Wir haben uns dann mit der Mitarbeiterin verständigt und sie meinte, das wäre schon bekannt und sie hätten es mit Insektenspray schon versucht in den Griff zu bekommen. Das Spray haben wir dann auch verwendet und dann waren sie auch weg. Allerdings kann man doch bevor Gäste kommen, so ein Zimmer nicht anbieten. Im Bad, am Bett, am Waschbecken. Das geht echt nicht.

Кондиционер не работал и от того что была уже ночь, я устала и не стала разбираться.
С утра выяснилось, что воды в душевой нет. Сходила к администратору, вызвали мастера и в течение 20 минут исправили.
Душ и туалет вместе, нет ограждений и поэтому все было в воде 😁
Хотела посушить волосы, фен не работал и уже не было времени разбираться. Вода была только платная в холодильнике и за маленькую бутылку отдала 20000 😁
Внизу спросила, возможность оставить чемодан на пару часов, отказали, потому что нет возможности.

Thao,Việt Nam,10.0,"- Địa điểm: Ngay trung tâm quận 1, di chuyển dễ dàng và tiện lợi. Tiện ích thì ở xung quanh đều có.

- Nội thất: Phòng đầu đủ tiện nghi với máy sấy và tủ lạnh, ấm đun nước. Tủ quần áo bố trí vừa khít ngay dưới chân giường. Giường êm ái dễ chịu, gần như đi du hí SG về mệt là mình ngủ mất đất trên chiếc giường êm ái í luôn. Phòng có 1 chiếc ghế sofa dài cho 2 người ngồi để xem TV. Phòng tắm hẹp nhưng bố trí bên trong hợp lý để sử dụng. Bộ bàn chải và kem đánh răng dùng 1 lần được chuẩn bị sẵn trong phòng tắm, cả lược nữa (mặc dù mình ko dùng bất cứ món nào).

- Chủ nhà: Bạn chủ cực kỳ nhiệt tình hỗ trợ mình nhận phòng, LalaHouse là kiểu nhận phòng tự động mà không cần gặp trực tiếp chủ nhà. Sau khi thanh toán xong sẽ được chủ nhà hướng dẫn trực quan cách nhận phòng qua các clip và thông báo ngay tại chỗ nghỉ. Bên dưới là quán cafe nho nhỏ, phòng mình ở là phòng giữa của tầng 2, trong khu nhà có 3 tầng.","- Chỗ đậu xe: Ở đây là trong hẻm nhỏ, nên cũng hạn chế đậu xe. Mình được chủ nhà hướng dẫn là muốn đậu xe thì gửi ở SaigonCenter gần đó. Phí giữ xe qua đêm cũng chấp nhận đc, chỉ tầm 45k nếu bạn gửi từ đêm hôm trước đến 10-11h sáng hôm sau. Tuy không phải là điểm trừ nhưng mình lưu ý cho mọi người để nếu có đi xe thì chuẩn bị phương án.

- Quán cafe ở dưới: Lúc mình nhận phòng và có thuê xe máy để đi, thì các bạn nhân viên cũng dặn đi dặn lại là không được để xe quá lâu, ảnh hưởng đến quán. Và cảm giác của mình là thấy mấy bạn í ko nice lắm, nên mình cũng thấy hơi ngại ngại lúc đi qua. Anw nó cũng đem lại cảm giác của mình hơi ko thoải mái lúc vào nhà."

Đối với mình mình cực kỳ không hài lòng, mình đã ở nhiều nơi và đây là lần đầu tiên mình đánh giá trên booking nhưng với sự bực bội như thế này dù trước giờ mình không muốn đánh giá một chỗ nào như thế."

Arcadia,Úc,8.0,"The apartment was in such a good location and very comfy! The shower was great and the bed also! Fab aircon and also a fan which was nice with the heat! The balcony is very cute unfortunately i visited in the summer so couldn’t stay outside for long. The staff were also lovely, Highly recommend",
Francesca,Ý,8.0,"Recommended accommodation in district 1, quiet and spacious. Water not very hot in the morning.",
Dino,Serbia,9.0,"Easy on-line communication, as we didn’t even meet the owners during our short 1N stay","It’s a bit confusing to find the first time, as you have to pass a very narrow and dark alley"
Regan,New Zealand,8.0,"Staff were friendly and helpful - they allowed us to drop our luggage off earlier before check in which we so appreciated! Room was clean and comfortable - even better than it looked in the photos, location walking distance to shops, markets, the war museum, and to tour operators too. No noise from outside or neighbours which was nice too. 
Do note there are no drinks stocked in the room fridges, we got used to having them available at every other stay and so missed them here because we kept forgetting to buy when we were out.",
Yanan,Úc,9.0,"Good location, close to everywhere. Room was really cosy, feel like home, had everything we needed including fridge and hair dryer. Can store luggage after check out.","It’s at a very tricky location, not on main street and grab won’t send you there. It would be good if host can make a little instruction on how to find the building. Just fyi to people who want to stay, locate The Bistro restaurant on Pastuer, when facing the restaurant, turn into the very tiny small lane on the right hand, and keep going then you’ll see it. No bottle water in the room but you can find convenient stores nearby."
Jere,Phần Lan,8.0,"In short, it is a good place to stay while in Saigon. The location of the property is really good for visiting sights and doing ""touristy"" stuff. It is also located on a cozy little alley so you won't hear the traffic at all as the buildings around it block all the noise. The room was also very clean and bathroom had nice fixtures and hot water at good pressure. Customer service is also very good. The couple times when I had problems (mainly with the lock), I used Whatsapp to contact the owner directly and got help every time super quickly. I also liked that there is a balcony and a large fridge/freezer combo.","The front door lock is too easy to use incorrectly and I (and couple other visitors) were quite frustrated with it. Secondly, there was no bottled water in the room (Saigon tap water is not safe to drink). It is easy to use Grab to have water delivered to you in bulk but there really should be some for the first day/night at the minimum, especially when it costs basically nothing. I also think that the mattress is way too cheap and stiff and should be upgraded."
Marie,Cộng hoà Séc,9.0,Everything,"Toilet seat was falling off and toilet brush could be provided, but we didn’t find this as a huge problem."
Eva,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"This was our second stay here. Superb location, comfortable and impeccably clean room.
Host is quick to respond to messages as well.
Hot water sometimes not as hot as hot as we'd like but we were stil able to take a shower.",
Natarajan,Mỹ,7.0,Excellent location.  Easy to get to the main attractions.  Lots of restaurants nearby.  Good number of spas nearby.,"What could be better - a little bit of discomfort with respect to communication with the owner of the place as there was really no one on site.  Lack of fresh towels -- I guess this is just to make the place better given its outstanding location.  The digital locks were to put it politely, a little temperamental. No fresh water etc.. These are little quibbles but some more effort into thinking from the perspective of a guest will make this place outstanding."
John,Mỹ,8.0,"Fun location tucked behind the Rex Hotel in a hem, Rusty Compass cafe in same alley, a favorite.  This is tourist zone and a historic center.","There is no desk, you communicate via email or phone or what’s app.  Front door coded entrance is very glitchy and should be replaced.  Write down or take pic of the elaborate info they will send you.  Balcony door has a lock handle unique to VN.  You will think you can’t lock it but you can with their explanation.  The good news is the staff whom you will never meet in person are responsive and competent via your phone apps."
Luke,Vương Quốc Anh,7.0,"Comfortable bed, great location and helpful staff.","Air con wasnt very good, you get a fan which does a good job to keep you cool while sleeping."
Cal,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,Fantastic location. Good communication. Comfy and clean. Quiet. Good shower. Great spot!,Can't really fault anything
Renata,Cộng hoà Séc,8.0,"Calm accomodation in hidden street. Towels were available and other (shower gel, shampoo).","Very low signal od WiFi - we tried to connect other WiFi , but it was low too. WiFi it’s important to me, because you need plan your trips, so we cannot . It was so disappointing."
Rainer,Đức,8.0,"Right next to one of the best Pho restaurants I ever been to in Vietnam. 
Price for Value is a 10/10",Unfortunately some constructions just started the day we arrived and the cafe was closed. No window in the room
Linda,Na Uy,7.0,"Stayed for two nights. I was offered a small discount to switch to a room on the 1st floor, which had no windows. The room felt more worn compared to the first one I stayed in and lacked power outlets in essential spots. It was not cleaned daily, which was a drawback but manageable for a short stay.

That said, the property still provided the basics: a comfortable bed, efficient air conditioning, and a peaceful atmosphere for rest. Centrally located in District 1 yet tucked away in a quiet alley, it’s a convenient spot for exploring the area. While unstaffed on-site, the host was always available via WhatsApp—very flexible and accommodating, even allowing luggage storage until the airport pick-up.",
Linda,Na Uy,8.0,"Stayed for one night. The room provided all the essentials: a comfortable bed, a reasonably clean space, efficient air conditioning, and a peaceful atmosphere for a good night's rest. Centrally located in District 1 yet tucked away in a quiet alley, the room was on the second floor at the back of the building. Although the windows were positioned high on the wall, the room remained bright enough and offered added privacy. While the property is unstaffed on-site, the host was always available via WhatsApp—very flexible and accommodating, even allowing us to store our luggage inside until check-in at 14:00",
Donald,Mỹ,8.0,"Staff, particularly Hanh, super! Situated near Saigon Center and many pubs and cafes in Dist. 1. But don't expect your taxi driver to find it. Located off the beaten path in an alleyway. Once you get inside thought, the rooms are nice and the price terrific. Bed was perfect! And if you like to get away from the city noises when in the city, this is the best you could get.","Unfortunately, my room had very high small windows that looked out to an ugly old apt building. Although there was some kind of blinds, it couldn't be adjusted and always gave me the feeling of someone easily looking in from across the way. Also, the TV wasn't working, but I'm sure if I told the manager they would have reacted swiftly."

Deborah,Úc,8.0,Location was fantastic. Not far to walk to the sights,
Sandra,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"It was good value, small and cute, exactly what I needed for a two night stay. 
Hanh was extremely responsive both before and during my stay. When I had a minor concern at the start of my stay, Hanh dealt with it immediately and got it resolved in a matter of minutes. 
The proximity to the famous market is walking distance (turn right, right again and 7 minutes walk). 
Lots of great places to eat, coffee shops and local food. 
The apartment building is very modern and extremely clean and the entry systems are very technological and secure. This apartment was just what I needed for a short stay.","Not much at all. 
Property was very clean, just need to clean down the side of the bed near the wall. When my EarPods fell down there, it was not good to see."
Huy,Bỉ,8.0,I was expecting a real breakfast.,Remove the breakfast option if you cannot provide it correctly
Eva,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"We loved our stay at Lala House. Right in the city centre with most everything in walking distance (and for anything further away Grab is cheap enough). It is down a tiny alley so small we barely even noticed it the first time we arrived so we spent a good 5-10 mins looking for it but it was part of the fun :) The room itself was spacious, the bed is one of the most comfortable we've ever slept in and it was big as well. AC placement is brilliant, close to the bed but it wasn't blowing right onto our heads. The bathroom was also a good size with good amenities. The host was really friendly and helpful, quick to respond on WhatsApp if we had a question.
This was a great find and we were really happy to stay here.",
Kris,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"Kitchen facilities were great. The room was clean, laundry was often and included in the price, and they often asked if I wanted the room cleaned by WhatsApp. There is internet hotspots on every floor and a cafe downstairs that was great. The place is in a great location too. There's a restaurant called Hmm. nearby. Despite the silly name we went 3 times.",I bruised my knee sitting on the toilet as the wall was so close! Unfortunately I think I booked the only room without a window to the outside. I wished there was a lamp or some other soft lighting for the middle of the night.
Rapine,Mỹ,9.0,"The location is perfect, in a calm small street just in the center of the busy pasteur street. The market and Nguyen street are less than 10 minutes away by walking.",
Ian,Sri Lanka,8.0,Located in a clean safe quaint alley just off a main street. Excellent breakfast to be had in neighbouring noodle shop.,Trouble locking door to balcony.. but otherwise an excellent choice for a quiet private stay.
Ella,Vương Quốc Anh,8.0,Good value for money & is a walkable distance to the main tourist spots. Communication with owner via WhatsApp was great and offered a free washing service which came in handy,We arrive a
Tsvetin,Luxembourg,8.0,Perfectly located within reach of everything in District 1. Quiet room despite being so central. The owner was responsive when we had queries even late at night. Free laundry service when you stay two nights and returned early the following morning. This saved us after a busy two weeks of travel.,Check in was a little troublesome as the door code did not work. The owner was however very helpful and created a new code. Still not very quick to get into the room. A little difficult to find as entry was in a back Alley. This also makes Grab pickups more challenging. Room was a little on the small side though appropriate for price. Finally there was a half drank evian bottle in the fridge when we arrived.
Yuichi,Thái Lan,8.0,"Location, cleanness, kindness, and cute cat.",Difficult to understand how to use smart door.
Michaela,Slovakia,8.0,"Apartment is located in narrow street ( so there are no cars and is more quite ), in basement is s cofee shop and most important, is located close to the Opera House, Central Post Office, Independent Palace, Bitexo Tower ( all in walking distance ). Near is a lot of restaurants, 7 eleven is 6 minutes of walk, Cirkle K on the opossite side also cca 6 minutes.
We had apartment with balcony ( is small but is enough ), but only with one chair, room is smaller but OK, bed is king size.","The owner allow us late check out ( 6 hours ) but for the price almost like for 1 extra day in spite of fact, we pay for first night and came next day at 11 a.m. We appriciate late check out but the price was a little bit high. 
There is only  one trash bin in the room, in bathroom, there is no daily cleaning the room, so maybe is good idea to let spare bags in the room."
Leah,Mỹ,9.0,"The hostess was wonderful and very responsive and quick with replies. I never really had to wait for an answer from her and she was very accommodating. The room itself had a little more wear than the photos show but overall it was very clean and smelled good which i think are the two most important things. The bed was also honestly a lot comfier than some of the other beds i stayed on so far and the sheets were very clean. The only negative i have to say is that there was a huge cockroach in my room but that wasn’t the fault of the hostess or anyone what cleaned and i was able to quickly get rid of it. The location is a little father then the main backpacking section of the district, but the value of the room and the security that i felt being there made up for it.",
Elizabeth,Pháp,7.0,"Good location, quiet with coffee shop downstairs. Easy online check in. Host very quick to respond.","No hot water and one night there was no water at all, but the problem was resolved within a couple hours. Nicer in photos than in reality."

Zebiko,Bồ Đào Nha,9.0,"Clean, comfortable room.
Free laundry with a minimum nights stay.
Great location, within walking distance to most important sites, restaurants, and comercial areas.
Friendly host.","Not negative, but to consider:
- access through an alley, and entrance by a Cafe! And not simple key/codes system for entrance;
- it's an apart hotel, so no permanent support/service."
James,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"Brilliant location, very comfortable bed, nice coffee shop",Only problem was smell from drains in bathroom and some mosquito in room when arrived. After shutting window problem solved!
Jason,Úc,8.0,The property was nice. Clean and good location.,Water pressure was not great but unfortunately the  city were doing maintenance on the water mains at the time. So it wasn’t the hotel owners fault.

Miza,Malaysia,9.0,"The location is superb, almost everything is 5 minutes walk away from the apartment. I was able to explore the city and enjoy the city walk seamlessly as along the hotel, the roadside is pedestrian friendly. There is laundry available and a pantry to reheat food. The facilities available made the travel so convenient. The room and toilet are very hygienic. The owner is very responsive too. I would definitely repeat staying here when visiting Ho Chi Minh again!",So far all is good

Rodrigo,Bồ Đào Nha,10.0,"LaLa House is a fantastic place to stay in Ho Chi Minh City. The location is excellent—just a short walk from two well-stocked shopping malls, where you’ll find everything you need, including a supermarket just 5 minutes away. Public transportation is easily accessible, making it convenient to explore the city.

The apartment itself is well-equipped, and in a city as hot as Ho Chi Minh, a fully functional air conditioning unit is absolutely essential—and thankfully, it works perfectly. There’s also a shared kitchen, which is great if you prefer to prepare your own meals.

For food lovers, the area is full of options. You can try authentic Vietnamese street food right nearby, and there’s even a healthy food restaurant just next door. If you’re looking for nightlife, Bui Vien Street is only a 15-minute walk away.

On top of that, the host is excellent—she made our self-check-in process smooth and was very helpful. We’re planning to stay here for about three months, and honestly, we see no reason to look for another place. Highly recommended!",Everything was fine.

The location of LALAhouse Spring Apartment was ideal, right in the heart of Saigon Center. It offered easy access to local attractions, dining, and shopping, making it a great choice for those looking to explore the city.","One thing to note was that the lobby area was undergoing renovations during our stay, which made the entrance feel less inviting than expected. However, once we got past the first floor, the experience improved significantly. Despite not having windows, the room was cozy and had a pleasant atmosphere."
Philip,Mỹ,6.0,Location was good,Cold shower and bed was hard and construction in lobby
Micky,Ireland (Ai Len),1.0,Location.,"Prison cell. No windows. No bedside lights. Old bedlinen smelled musty, not a clean smell. No rubbish bin. Tiny bathroom, cold water sometimes  particularly in morning. Wi fi no signal.
A taxi from the airport, ordered by the property cost us 550 vnd, about 20 euro, paid in cash to the property. We organised a really good return taxi, cost 120 vnd, about 6 euro. Perhaps it might be better to organise your own taxi?
Two bed deluxe studio? Terrible!"

Emma,Vương Quốc Anh,6.0,The location was great. The little cafe downstairs was convenient to work in and get a morning coffee/drink and you get 10% off for staying on site. Air con good and large tv!,"We didn’t have a good overall experience tbh. We were checked into the wrong room, and all communication is done via WhatsApp. So we were back and forward with the manager, we then got moved to a different room which also wasn’t the same as the one we booked and it also wasn’t clean yet, we walked into a dirty room. She said the one we booked had guests in so it’s not possible to have that one but this one is the same.. I explained that she needs to ensure there are pictures of both rooms that are classed as deluxe doubles on booking.com to avoid disappointment. We had to pay in cash but they didn’t have change and we had to wait until the next day for change. The bed isn’t comfortable for me and I woke up with a sore back and had restless sleeps. The windows of the rooms look onto the corridor which has automatic lights with movement so we were bothered by the light from neighbours coming in and out. I ended up asking for a discount as we hadn’t received our change back yet and she agreed on 100k which equates to around £3 but she wanted to cancel the full booking on booking.com and then book directly with her and we just thought it was more hassle than it was worth so we ended up just saying to leave it. Once I got the change back it was 99k short but I was over it by that point."

If you need to storage your luggages because maybe you go for few days on a tour and then you go back, that’s not possible, there isn’t any room where to lock your belongings and in Ho Chi Minh City is not possible to find a place where to storage your stuff. In that case i suggest to book a hotel that is able to provide this service. You can leave your luggages in a corner for few hours."

他の人も口コミで書いてるけど、おそらくハズレの部屋だったかもしれない。
上の方にちょっと窓があるだけ。安く滞在するには十分だけど、Booking.comでの写真とちょっと違っててビックリした。

Creo que no es justo vender una habitación normal sin avisar que no tiene ventana. Además, las fotos de la habitación, al reservar, tienen ventana. 
El frigorífico, las tuberías, el edificio en sí hace bastante ruido. No hay ruido de la calle pero si interno. El ascensor hace un sonidito cada vez que para en cada piso que molesta mucho y te despierta. 
La ubicación está bien pero recomiendo llegar por la mañana o cuando haya luz, ya que por la noche quizás es difícil de encontrar y está en un callejón bastante oscuro. Quizás para una mujer sola es un poco incómodo."

They kindly let me leave my bag at the hotel after check out while I explored the city some more. It’s a great base to explore Ho Chi Minh City! It was great value for money and I felt very safe as a solo female traveller.","There is no room service or food services available in this hotel- breakfast comes from the branch next door. 
The rooms with the window out to the hallway (looking at a wall)- can be very dark. It’s not a problem, just something to be aware of when booking."
Sally,Úc,9.0,"The location is great, just a 5-10 minute walk to Ben Thanh Markets with plenty of restaurants close by.  The hotel is clean and modern.  The breakfast is nice but basic.  We were upgraded to a bigger room with bigger windows but the view wasn't great (not a big deal).  TV was good with good picture and sound.  Hotel staff were friendly and professional. The shower was hot with good pressure and the bed was comfortable.  The room was a good size.",
Joseph,Vương Quốc Anh,7.0,The staff were so so friendly and welcoming. Really helpful with anything we needed - holding onto our bags or ordering a taxi etc. Additionally the bed was super comfortable and the room generally very nice and well kept.,"Unfortunately, I think this might just be an inevitable with hotels sometimes, we found a bed bug in our bed which obviously dampened the experience a bit. Aside from, nothing bad to say about the hotel, lovely place."
Doan,Mỹ,7.0,Cleaning surface was the best! Hands down! They would even clean long after typical cleaning hours to ensure our room was always clean!,"The shower, althought comfortable and clean had the worst water temperature and pressure. It would be cold most of the time or boiling hot when trying to adjust, but wouldn't last, just mostly cold. And when you finally got it warm, only a little bit of water would come out and it wouldn't last long."
Kiriaki,Úc,9.0,Really good location. Room was clean and staff were really helpful.,Nothing
German,Uruguay,9.0,Very clean,"Breakfast is paid, located in the other partner building"
Janna,Úc,7.0,The location was only around 10 min walk to Ben Thanh market. Hotel was good value for money. A lot of cafes and convenience stores nearby. Staff was helpful and nice. There was also netflix on the TV.,"The hotel had Poor sound proofing, can hear guest talking outside."

Walter,Áo,7.0,"a great location, modern & attractive design, rooms were clean and comfortable and worth the price",while booking and checking in there was quite some confusion as there is a twin hotel two doors down!
Monique,Úc,9.0,We stayed on the 3 rd floor. The room was facing the main street . We found it was not noisy at all as i think the windows are double glazed . Big floor to ceiling windows which is very nice and bright. The bathroom  was nicely renovated and everything looks new. Breakfast was nice and simple. A very decent spread of hot meals . The bed was comfortable and sheets were very clean. Staff was happy to accommodate us with our requirements. The location was very close to a lot of restaurants and cafes. About 7 mins walk to Ben Thanh Market,No swimming pool

Carlee,Úc,7.0,"Good location - given the price it was walkable to the main district 1 sites (there are hotels closer to the action but they are more expensive).
Comfortable bed and good shower. 
Front desk staff were friendly and helpful.","Noisy from street noise (even in the seventh floor) but that’s to be expected.
Breakfast was the low point. We had had good breakfasts in all our other Vietnam hotels so had similar expectations but this was disappointing - so much so that we didn’t bother with our included breakfast after the first day. The coffee was the first undrinkable coffee we had anywhere in Vietnam, I think the butter might have been off, the only juice was not actually fresh juice but orange squash/cordial that had to be diluted, noodles were dry, the lady at the omelette station was super grumpy, the only spread on offer was pineapple jam :-( Such a shame after such great breakfasts at other similar quality hotels. Maybe if this was our first hotel instead of our last we wouldn’t have had such high expectations."

Jaejin90,Hà Lan,7.0,Spacious room and bathroom!,Bugs ruined the hotel a bit for me. The door has a small opening which allows bugs from the hallway to get into the room. My partner got bitten all over by mosquitoes. I've also seen some centipedes crawling in the room.

Igor,Slovenia,7.0,"The location is great - close to Walking Street, the market and the Opera building","One of the rooms that we were given had no window or actually had a window looking into a small shaft (2 x 2 meters) with no sunlight whatsover. They have quite a few rooms of this type although their booking.com site doesn't mention ""rooms without windows"". When I complained they tried to convince me that there was no misleading on their part, that the rooms had windows, just no view. So be carefull that you don't get this type of room."

Lauren,Úc,7.0,Room was clean and modern and the location was great - quiet but central to all the tourist spots.,"Room were lacking in character. Staff were very disinterested, not even looking up when we entered the lobby. We had a late fight out of HCM and asked for a late check out on one of the two rooms we booked so we could shower before our flight. Despite having available rooms (hotel was not at capacity), we were told we would have to pay half the room rate for a 4pm check out (a few hours longer than the 12pm normal check out). Disappointing when in all our other stays in Vietnam the staff were a standout."
Kevin,Canada,9.0,"Clean facilities, great location, and very comfy beds",

Tu,Úc,9.0,We were able to book rooms for a group of 9 last minute and they did the best they could with putting us together in the one building. They have 2 building that are right next door to each other so it wasn’t a big deal. Our biggest regret was not booking for longer!,The shower pressure from the rainfall shower head was not the best so had to use the handheld hose. It was a bit of a pain was the holder was not very high. The laundry service is also per piece as opposed to by kg.
Holger,Úc,9.0,"Location is excellent in the centre of District 1, only a short walk or grab ride from most attractions, and the staff was very helpful",Triple E Hotel has a policy that does not allow guests to have visitors after 10 pm

Sergei,Nga,8.0,"-Room was clean and secure.
-Comfortable bed.
-Good sound insulation.
-Polite stuff.
-In the very middle of city, too overcrowded nearby though.","-The breakfast could be more diverse, almost the same and quite limited set of dishes every day. For one or two days its ok, but on the third you cannot already enjoy it.  
-The water pressure in shower could be higher, sometimes temperature of water had being dramatically changing to burning hot for a while."
Nenad,Pháp,8.0,"Location is great,  room is spacious,  clean and comfortable","Breakfast area is too small for the 2 Hotel using it, this leads to not enough seating place, people looking for plates, food running out, 20min to get your eggs...

Breakfast","Bed was very soft
Laundry service a bit pricey"
Joy,Úc,7.0,"Great location and amenities, clean rooms.","When we were checking out, they claimed multiple of our rooms had towels that were too dirty to clean and demanded we compensate. Most of us were confused as we only used them as usual and were forced to pay 200k for the towels. Our tip for future travellers is to take a photo of your towels in case they produce pictures of towels from other times"
Anna,Philippines,7.0,"The only notable aspect for me was the staff at the lobby/ information.
The elevator was fast, the bed was comfortable and I love the pillows.","The location. It's not really at the city center. Going to the real(?) center where the opera house and nice buildings, and shopping malls are located takes several minutes of walking through streets with a lot of people loitering.
Breakfast was forgettable, with the same food served everyday.
The room, altho adequate is not as clean. The real problem is the shower room and toilet that get flooded whenever you take a shower. I don't like tiles that get soaking wet, so I spend several minutes trying to mop and dry the whole area. I also don't see why they put a bathtub that is actually a part of the bedroom, separated only by a curtain!!"
Felix,Singapore,8.0,They promised a quiet room and kept their promise.,Good location and nice staff.
Stacie,Mỹ,7.0,"Property is good.  Clean linen.  Bathroom could be a tab cleaner.  Have windows in my room but no view at all, you see an exterior wall.  Most of the staffs are very nice with one exception, today during breakfast, the noodle lady with glasses.  I asked for a bowl of noodles and quail eggs but she said there is no quail eggs, I looked over and I see some.  She said only one quail egg per bowl which I did not even get one in my bowl.  Then she gave me one.  This is ridiculous.  Made me felt like I have to beg for quail egg. These are no golden eggs either.  For the quality of this hotel and standard, should better train these staff.  I told the front staff what happened and that noodle lady had the audacity to stare at me when I went to get watermelon.  OMG!  I feel so threaten.",The lady with glasses at the noodle section at breakfast.
Roisin,Vương Quốc Anh,8.0,"Lovely friendly reception staff.
Comfortable bed and pillows. Clean room.

The hotel was clean and contemporary with a good choice of breakfasts, located in a quieter street near all the major attractions.",The gym was pretty small. We couldn’t use the electrical socket next to the bed as water has got into it and smoke came out when we put a plug in. However the staff did try to fix it straight away and promised to get an electrician in the next day (we left so didn’t find out if it got fixed!)
Olive,Ireland (Ai Len),9.0,"Room was absolutely beautiful, exactly how you see it on website. Staff were brilliant and the breakfast was Devine.

Zulaifah,Singapore,9.0,Very clean and close to Ben tahn market and shops.,Nothing
Claresta,Malaysia,8.0,"Location is in a quiet area but still within walking distance to Ben Thanh market, although in the less busy side. It is quite convenient for business travellers as it is not too difficult to get a taxi or too much traffic in this area. The hotel was nicely renovated and a surprisingly big room size for Vietnamese standards. Everything was clean and the aircon works very well. Breakfast choices were limited as expected from a smaller boutique hotel but delicious. Do be aware that there are two Triple E Metros that are separated by another shop so be sure of which one you're staying at, so you don't enter the wrong one like I did! 

There is an area outside to sit at to wait for your taxi / delivery comfortably.","When I checked in, the female receptionist was not very friendly but the rest of the receptionists were much better. I also needed to make urgent changes to my reservation but they were not able to help modify the reservation as I booked through Booking.com instead of directly."
Thao,Việt Nam,8.0,"Friendly and helpful staff. The welcome drink was so good we were obsessed. Clean and comfortable room with smart tv. Convenient location, cafes anf restaurants nearby. lots of traffic but you don’t hear it much from inside the room. Basic but decent buffet breakfast.",None

Ívar,Iceland (Ai-xơ-len),7.0,I loved the staff. They were nice and helpful. There was construction outside my room so I woke up early the first day but they changed my room. Then a button fell off my pants and they fixed it for free. They also clean the room late if you want. Even after 21:00.,"The room they gave me first shouldn't be used right now because of extreme noise from 08-16 at least. I stayed for 7 nights and the first 5 were great but I got many bites my last two nights, bed bugs or something."

Kate,Vương Quốc Anh,8.0,"The property was very central easy to walk around. The Twin room was clean, modern neutrally decorated the individual beds were larger than single and comfortable.  The room had enough space for 2 person plus large luggage so as not to feel cramped.
Breakfast dining area was sufficient and well decorated","Breakfast was adequate but could have done with more fruit.  Also you had to come down early otherwise it would get packed and food items like the minimal fruit slices would not be topped up.
The pictures of the “gym” are deceiving. This is in the adjoining building and consists of no more than a tiny area."

James,Nhật Bản,7.0,"Nice staff, pretty good location","I stayed twice, on my way through Saigon going in and then again going out. The hotel has two locations, a few meters from each other. The first stay was at one location, and when I added a second night was given a free upgrade to a large, quiet room with a great view and even a bathtub. Based on that stay, much higher ratings would have been appropriate; however, my return stay was in the other hotel, the room had a putrid odor, and workers started drilling the wall from next-door at 8am. Also, there is no breakfast at either location regardless of the room price. Nice free coffee though."
Penn,Singapore,8.0,"I like the great hospitality that was provided by the staff there. The lady situated at the concierge tries her best to answer all our enquiries and provided all the help she could.
The staff there are all very friendly and polite. 
The security guard was also very nice and friendly,
They will go an extra mile to take care of elderly and ensuring our safety by asking grab drivers to come right infront of the hotel for us to get on the car. They will also open the door for us to enter and exit the car.","the room was abit dark and the Colour of the walls don’t give off a clean and pleasant vibes. other than that , all is very good."

Alex,Malaysia,9.0,huge separate shower room and good water pressure on the 7th floor,a local friend came and visit and he was asked to leave his id document with the front desk! didn't know that is legal!!
Martin,Úc,9.0,"The rooms were spacious, clean, extremely modern and water pressure was great!

The staff were one of the highlights. We lost one of our phones on a taxi and the receptionist worked tirelessly to help us trackdown, communicate and organise its retrieval.",No functioning kitchen yet
Natasha,Vương Quốc Anh,8.0,"Beautiful, large, modern room in a new hotel. Walking distance to main areas",It was a little dark in the room with not the best lighting. Every morning we were woken up by construction work next door. Clearly not the hotels fault but unfortunately impacted our sleep - not great for light sleepers!
Robert,Úc,7.0,"clean, modern, brilliant staff",nothing… it doesn’t try to be anything other than functional and comfortable
Siu,Hồng Kông,9.0,"stayed for 4 nights at room 504, feels like a freshly built hotel / everything worked well in general / that single door for shower and toilet area was a bit of a surprise at first but indeed a smart design after getting used to it / staff is nice / location is brilliant, a 24-hr convenience store just around the corner of the road, and food, and coffee shops / the complimentary coffee from the bar certainly a plus","the tv sometimes didn't connect to the Internet during daytime, never encountered such at night
the door may not lock properly if just leave it close by itself, easily resolved if you force it to close, tricky though as you wouldn't notice just from its appearance
the glass wall of toilet/shower is a bit too transparent"
Esther,Đức,9.0,"The staffs are amazing. They are friendly and helpful from the front desk to the doorbell/ security. The room itself is very clean and well though out, nice minimalist design and very functional. It’s near a lot of eateries in the area and still in good walking proximities (15-20 mins) to museums etc.",You can hear when someone is talking in the corridor (coming out of the lift) but it’s not that they stay for long there.
Midwaymetals,Việt Nam,9.0,It is a brand new hotel with very comfortabe rooms and nice bathrooms well designed layout with desk to allow some work as well.

Samuel,Quần đảo Bắc Mariana,8.0,"The location is excellent as the surrounding neighborhood is away from the touristy areas but still packed with street food, coffee houses and restaurants.   The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  The internet was fast and reliable.",The bathroom shower drains very slowly.  If you take a shower longer than 1 minute than it will overflow to the point where water will seep out the shower door and into the bathroom and into the room itself.  I had to turn the water off several times during the shower to wait for the water to drain before resuming.   The sound of the elevator bell can be heard from the room.  There is poor sound insulation as I can hear neighbors talking down the hall.
Kate,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,"The staff on reception, particularly Carrot-Phuong -Fo went out of his way to help me book an outward journey coach :) Such a lovely enthusiastic and totally professional young man.",There was an unfortunate mistake with room cleaning….. however the manageress apologised and helped as best she could!
Socheata,Campuchia,9.0,The new location (Triple E Hotel 156) had a deluxe suite that was incredibly spacious. The room had a bath tub as well which was a nice surprise upgrade from Triple E Hotel 146. The staff were lovely and accommodating whether they were the receptionist or the security guard out front. They were as helpful as they could be regarding any questions or problems we had.,"The twin room at 156 seemed to be quite smaller than the twin room at 146, which was a bit unfortunate. There was a strange smell of cigarettes that would linger in the rooms, we'd have to turn on the air conditioner to get rid of it."
Yohanesbule,Indonesia,9.0,"The hotel is very new. Like 3 months old. Location is superb. New bedding, brand new smart TV, clever mechanism on the bathroom door.","Standard of the hotel is OK, yet it can be improved somehow to become small and excellent."
Tjiska,Mỹ,9.0,"Exceptional customer service provided by staff - great tour and restaurant recommendations upon request as well as prompt and responsive support for all travel related needs.

Brenda,Vương Quốc Anh,8.0,helpful and attentive.  property was clean and the room was comfortable and quiet despite being over the road. A/C was good and necessary.,"Staffs’ English was limited, so challenging to communicate but manageable, especially with translate app. they warned us that they would be spraying for bugs, but I thought they meant outdoors.  after we went to our room, however, they sprayed in hallways and  not only was it noisy but extremely noxious.  that was a bit negative as I already was suffering headache."

Andrik,Singapore,3.0,"Good location, male staffs were great - especially Henry, exemplary staff.","My room was on the 7th floor (highest) - despite this, I had 5 sleepless nights as the unit faces the street and its a constant car horns, engines and people talking. I could hear people talking at the ground floor. I spoke to the staff and they said to change room would be a downgrade of the room-type. Plus it seems they are already 100% aware of this issue. The car noises are a constant barrage throughout the night - peaking at 5am onwards. This is a shame because it would've been a 5/5 stay but not being able to sleep for 5 nights has killed my travel experience."

You are a short walk away from Ben Thanh market and Saigon Centre. The room was great and comfortable. Blackout curtains helped. The bathroom was spacious and had everything you needed. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend it, and I would stay there again if I ever find myself in HCMC. It was a bit on the expensive side for me, but it was worth the money spent for the last few days in Vietnam. I also loved the fact that I could connect to my netflix account on the tv","I don't think it's dislike, but the fact that there are two properties next to each other with the same name. After a delay and arriving close to 4 am, I couldn't figure out where to go.

There was no electric kettle provided in the room. The gym was not in an enclosed space but situated in front of a café, making it unsuitable for anyone serious about working out. Additionally, not many staff members spoke good English."

Lin,Đài Loan,6.0,價格不算貴，位置優越，房間與照片落差不大,服務項目中有一樣設定我認為是好的但卻沒有做到，也就是客房打掃這個功能，飯店有提供以按鈕亮燈的方式告知服務人員是否有人在內或是需要服務的，但是當我於下午一點左右按下客房打掃的燈後，一直到晚上十點都沒有人清潔。第一，如果這項服務有時間限定是否要先提前告知顧客？因為我是完全沒有被告知這項服務是有時間限定的。第二，如果是飯店清掃人員忘記或是沒注意，是否要進行改善？

La stanza molto sporca, piena di capelli neri sul pavimento e sul letto, nessuno ha soddisfatto la mia richiesta di pulire. Molto sporco anche il corridoio. Una sera abbiamo avuto solo un filo di acqua bollente dal rubinetto (anche se posizionato su acqua fredda) e niente acqua in doccia. Al check out ci hanno fatto aprire la valigia nella hall sostenendo che dalla stanza mancava un appendiabiti e una decorazione floreale, che ovviamente non hanno trovato nella valigia. Alla mia richiesta di parlare con il direttore, mi è stato risposto che non era possibile. Saremmo dovuto tornare per altre due notti dopo un'escursione fuori città, siamo fuggiti nell'hotel di fronte, che presenta le stesse caratteristiche ma è decisamente più pulito e costa esattamente la metà."

Aj,Hà Lan,10.0,"If you would compare this hotel to a 4 or 5 star hotel in the same street you wouldn’t see the difference. The hospitality from the personnel of this hotel is fenomenal, the receptionist tries his best to speak with you. He asks how your day was, what you have done today, what you are going to do the next day, and helps you with taxis and small things for your flight or vacation. Even though it are small things it makes you feel welcome and this is what a great hotel is supposed to do. The noise cancelling is absolutely great, of course you sometimes hear an ambulance but that is normal, the best thing is that you hear no loud music from coffee places or clubs. When I first stepped in the room I was shocked at how luxurious the room was, for a 2 star hotel the room was so good.

Tom,Thụy Điển,7.0,"Jag begärde och fick ett rum som vette mot gården på 10 våningen. Det gjorde att jag knappt hörde trafiken nere på gatan. Bra skön säng! Hotellet har bra och snabb service. Jag klagade på segt internet och då bytte de routern ute i korridoren. Blev stor skillnad, tack för det! Så plus för personalen. Läget är bra. Hotellet ligger i Distrikt 1 och mycket nära en stadspark. Fanns faktiskt träd längs trottoaren. Lite ovanligt. Gångavstånd till bland annat Saigon Centre som är en lagom stor galleria/mall. Om man nu pallar att med att korsa gatorna i den intensiva trafiken och dessutom är det som bekant hettan.","Trafiken på gatan är intensiv, även om hotellet låg på en sidogata. Kanske onödigt att ständigt klaga på trafiken i dessa städer (Hanoi och Saigon) men den är, i alla fall för mig, stundtals outhärdlig. Men ännu värre i Hanoi. Trafiken påverkar starkt mitt val av boende."

Lots of restaurants around and enjoyed staying in district 3 for a change. Comfy bee. The kitchen had plates etc, which was great - a lot of places we stayed at didn't which made a kitchen useless. Kitchen also had a small hotplate, so handy for those staying longer term. Loved the place and highly recommend it. The first place we stayed at that the photos were a true reflection.","The aircon was quite noisy if turned up. We were on the 4th floor (402) at the back of the hotel so no road noise, however some noise from the apartment on the 5th floor. Sounded like they were moving furniture through the night for days, I sleep with ear plugs so wasn't an issue and not the hotel's fault. 

Bed only came with two pillows, and it took some convincing to get a further two. Hotels should have two per person so this should be standard."

the bad point was that our room smelled like cigarette from previous guests. the staff gave us another room after 2 days which was nice. however the hotel should reinforce their policy with smoking guests to avoid disturbing others.

Kate,Úc,10.0,"While this hotel is in District 3, it's basically on the edge of District 1, so super close to all of the main attractions. The room itself was everything you would expect in a Western Hotel room plus more (including Kitchen facilities). There are plenty of restaurants and mini marts very close by (within the block).
There were cheaper places in District 3, but with this location, plus how nice the room was, I'd definitely come back to stay here for the convenience and ease of being in such a nice place.","For the most part, the room was fairly quiet. It is on a one way road which can get a little busy and noisy, but it generally quietens down after about 10pm(ish). The last night I was there, Vietnam won some kind of important football match and there was constant banging from a party directly across the street until about 1am. While I'm sure this doesn't happen often, and not the hotels fault at all, it was incredibly loud and impossible to sleep."
Moshe,Israel,6.0,"This is a modern, clean and nicely located hotel. Very nice and helpful staff. Spacious room and all the facilities one would expect to see in a modern hotel.","There is a construction site adjacent to the hotel. Literally. The external walls of the hotel and the building which is being built are joined. From 7:30am every day including weekends there are construction noises including hammering. One day the works continued until 2:30am the next day! We could not sleep. 
I don’t know how tall will be the new building but the construction is now on the 2nd floor. 
Once this construction work will be done, the hotel will be 5/5."
Darren,Vương Quốc Anh,1.0,"The room was great, clean & well equipped","There are construction works going on day and night immediately next to and physically adjoining the apartments at present. 
I’d personally recommend the accommodation be avoided for the time being therefore, unless deafeningly loud banging, clanging and scraping at 1am is what you’re after. 
The receptionists were great, but the manager (who hid behind the scenes and communicated solely through the young female receptionist when I was complaining the following morning) was far less impressive and less credible. 
No refund, not even a partial one, and very disappointingly, not the slightest mention in advance of the fact that 24hr construction works are being being undertaken right next to the accommodation. 
Avoid for some time if I were you, and consider alternative accommodation if you’ve already booked…"
Than,Singapore,10.0,Spacious room and bathroom cleanliness. The apartment is very clean and the staffs are very warm. Initially I thought apartment won’t provide the shampoo and bath so I brought my own but they provided everything. Same as 4 star hotel standard.,Basically all ok.

We asked the reception and they said this is ongoing for last 6 months and they have permisson to do this. We couldnt sleep!! They shouldnt allow customer book the rooms adjacent to the construction wall.

We had originally booked another apartment weeks before arriving in Ho Chi Minh City also on booking.com (Jessie Apartments).
On our arrival into the city our booking was cancelled with no explanation despite already having conversations with the host and telling them our arrival time! 

With no where to stay, how lucky we were that this set of apartments had a free room.  It was very spacious, super clean, the most comfiest bed we have slept in so far in SE Asia with wonderful linen. A fantastic shower and lovely bathtub too (very rare but so welcome). Our apartment was cleaned daily and free water, coffee and towels soap etc replaced, 
The staff on reception were so welcoming and friendly. It was actually in a better location than we had previously booked too, close to District 1.
The free washing and drying facilities on the mezzanine floor were an added bonus too and super efficient with free liquids and softeners.
The host allowed us a slightly later check out too which was much appreciated.
All in all we cannot recommend this apartment highly enough! It was wonderful with wonderful staff too and excellent value for money.

Thank you for a great stay.",I booked a city view room and the only comment is that the street is very noisy with traffic and motorbikes and also there is an extremely busy cafe/bar next door with pavement tables. Personally I wasn't bothered by the noise but I would suggest that if noise is likely to be a problem for you that you may be better at the back of the hotel.

The communication with hotel staffs didn't go well. If you consider about airport pick up service, it seems they usually don't offer it although it says it's possible on booking.com webpage. We discussed and they tried to do the service, and they said that the driver is holding my name, but there was no my name. I was looking around the airport for an hour and finally I came to the hotel by myself at the middle of the night. Maybe they tried their best, but I felt I wasted my time which I don't like most.

Grigoriadou,Vương Quốc Anh,10.0,Aurora apartments was a very nice place to stay. The room was big enough for 1 person (and it would be good for 2 I think).

Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and clean with a bathtub. 10-15mins walking to District 1 (depends where you want to go exactly). Close to a nice park too.,they only thing to keep in mind is that it is on a busy street (at least my room was) so it gets pretty noisy from early in the morning due to traffic.

Erik,Bỉ,9.0,"Hôtel très bien situé, à quelques pas de la plage, exploité par des vietnamiens. Très accueillant, personnel toujours aux petits soins qui est particulièrement efficace, souriant, sympathique.

Les prix étaient sans doute un peu élevés compte tenu du pouvoir d'achat local, mais le rapport qualité prix reste excellent. La communication avec l'hôtel avant mon arrivée a également été très efficace. J'y retournerais sans hésiter.",

Las habitaciones son muy nuevas y espaciosas, el baño es de hotel 5 estrellas. La zona contaba con algunos restaurantes y bares pero está a unos 15 minutos caminando del centro.

Нет, не всё.

Из плюсов - мыло, шампунь, зубные пасты и щётки. Чай/кофе и вода в номере. Чужие поношенные ветнамки) Да, они были, но б/у.

Ещё один плюс - можно с животными. Доплату за них не берут.","Запах плесени в номере. Дочка не страдает аллергией, но у неё пошла сильная интоксикация со рвотой и температурой. Не советую, если вы и без такой манифестации аллергик. Та же история случилась у нашей кошки(

Очень уставшая мебель. Местами - откровенно фу. Не хотелось возвращаться домой - так было неуютно, грязно и мерзко. Шкаф дышал на ладан. В кондиционере был снят блок очистки, за счёт чего он выглядел страшно - как после ампутации."
英希,Nhật Bản,8.0,早朝移動てさのために利用した。Googleマップでホテルの位置はわかるがマップ画像ではかくにんできない。げんちでは、大通りから路地突き当たりにすぐみえます。,この価格帯では遮音は十分ではない。音が気になるのであればさらに上位価格帯のホテルを探し他方がいいかも。移動のたの泊まりで空港に泊まるよりぜんぜんよい。
Dylan,Pháp,6.0,Emplacement proche de l'aéroport,"- Difficile de trouver, l'adresse sur Google map n'est pas correcte
- Ne prends pas la carte bancaire malgré ce qui est indiqué sur la fiche d'établissement
- Pas de télé dans la chambre, malgré ce qui est indiqué sur la fiche de la chambre
- Le manque d'équipements dans la chambre
- Salle de bain pas forcément propre avec siphon bouché de la douche ce qui trempe toute la salle de bain
- La femme de ménage/ personnelle qui crie dans les couloirs à 8h du matin"

Холодильник большой и мощный. Нет насекомых. Есть балкон. Каждый день бесплатная вода.","Кот вытащил мусор и волосы из под тумбочки. Пыль за кроватью. Полы грязные. Не было кружек.

La camera è molto spaziosa, il letto comodissimo. Presente uno split per il raffrescamento ed il  riscaldamento e bollitore con Tè e bottigliette d'acqua gratuite.

Кстати, гугл карты приводят к отелю не с той стороны! Поэтому нужно обходить ещё минут 10.","Грязно, везде чьи-то волосы. В номере неприятно находиться. Поселили нас в какое-то полуподвальное помещение, с маленьким окном наверху, откуда ничего не видно. В постеле были какие-то прыгучие маленькие мошки. Хорошо, что не покусали. Очень хорошая слышимость. Мы все время слышали общение персонала. Ну и, конечно, номер вообще не выглядит как на картинках. Мы были всего 2 ночи. Поздно прилетели, рано улетели, а 1 целый день гуляли и почти не были в отеле, поэтому не стали разбираться и съезжать, но это было ужасно."

Beim Bertreten des Zimmers kam uns ein überaus unangenehmer modriger Geruch entgegen, dass wir gerne wieder gegangen wären. Beim Blick ins Badezimmer war auch nachvollziehbar warum. Die weißen Fliesen an der Wand sind mit schwarzem Schimmel überzogen und das Gebläse an der Decke lässt man lieber aus, um die Sporen nicht weiter zu verteilen. Da hilft es auch nicht goldfarbene Bodenfliesen zu verlegen. 
Wir waren drei Wochen in Vietnam reisen und das war mit Abstand die schlechteste Unterkunft. Keinerlei Rechtfertigung für das Preis-Leistungs Verhältnis. Wir empfehlen diese Unterkunft definitiv nicht weiter."

Bevor wir richtig begrüßt wurden hat man uns zum zahlen aufgefordert, nicht einmal unsere schweren Rucksäcke durften wir abstellen.  Bei Fragen konnte uns das Personal nicht weiterhelfen, wir brauchten ca 4 Anläufe bis uns ein Taxi bestellt wurde.
Im gesamten Hotel stank es nach Schimmel und es waren Wasserflecken an den Wänden sichtbar. Wir bekamen ein (dafür viel zu teures) Zimmer mit Fenster zum Flur. Zwar wurde bei unserer Ankunft der Flur gewischt, aber ehrlicherweise wirkte nichts sauber. Aus dem Schrank des Zimmers drang übler Geruch hervor, darin lag ein benutztes Handtuch und an der Außenseite des Schranks klebte ein (einst rotes) Gummibärchen. Von Ekel durchzogen schliefen wir mit FFP2 Maske im Gesicht auf unseren Regenponchos, weil wir nicht wissen wollten was unter der fleckigen Decke auf uns wartet.

Нам одобрили поздний заезд и поздний выезд, но никто не предупредил о оплате и сумме оплаты. Из за чего мы оказались в неловком положении, так как поменяли деньги ровно столько сколько было указано. В номерах было грязное полотенце, одеяло без пододеяльника и еще грязное. Сантехника грязная, я в силу своей брезгливости протирала крышку унитаза спиртовыми салфетками, по итогу на них было видно темные пятна. На этаже постоянно кричали дети. Утро началось с того, что меня разбудил звук отхаркивающих или отрыгивающих соседей. Что бы взять с нас деньги о которых нас не предупредили они возили моего мужа по дождю в разные банкоматы, в которых нельзя снять деньги с нашей карты.

La chambre est bien agencée, grand lit , réfrigérateur, 2 bouteilles d'eau, 2 mi-an li traditionnelles ( nouilles) une bouilloire un sèche cheveux mais toujours ces détails crispants: une serrure qui brinquebale, un éclairage déficient, une lampe de la chambre claquée, il faut se lever pour éteindre la lumière ( commode, dans chambre aveugle!) mais j'ai pas trouvé de corbeille. Dans la salle de bains, une douche bien chaude ( *****) au debit élevé, du liquide de bains fourni.....mais flacon vide, shampoing et flacon plein. Une brosse à dents + dentifrice fournis de même qu'un peigne  (un peu chiche, on a connu mieux !) Un lavabo avec un morceau du robinet qui vous reste dans la main, tous les clients doivent le remettre sans rien dire, et des toilettes ras, si ce n'est qu' un soupirail en hauteur communique avec les toilettes de,l'étage, donc a vous l'intimité, sans  chercher a le savoir  vous savez ce que fait votre voisin ou votre voisine ou votre voisin et votre voisine.....toutes les.combinnaisons sont possibles!
Une climatisation efficace, mais il faut avoir l'habitude de ces engins car aucun mode d'emploi  n'est affiché et refusant le 18 degres 'programme, j'ai  longtemps cherche où et combien de temps il me fallait pour modifier la température et la ventilation.
Objectivement, dans cette rue il y a mieux pour pratiquement le même prix, mais voilà quand on doit réserver trois jours avant votre départ parce que votre chauffeur n'est pas'libre, on prend ce que l'on trouve...",

Nonostante i tentativi di riparazione da parte del personale, ci hanno trasferito in un'altra stanza. Qui la situazione non è migliorata: la pulizia era scarsa, l'insonorizzazione praticamente inesistente, e la porta del bagno non si chiudeva correttamente. Inoltre, c'era un buco nel muro del bagno che dava sulle scale, con un cartone messo a coprire il foro – senza alcuna finestra. Abbiamo anche trovato insetti nel bagno e nel letto e un odore sgradevole persistente.

Per completare l'esperienza negativa, la mattina presto avevamo bisogno di riposare per un volo, ma i rumori provenienti dal piano inferiore sono stati così intensi che ho dovuto chiedere ai ragazzi di fermarsi. Un soggiorno che non consiglierei assolutamente a nessuno!"

Ngoài ra còn có thể ngắm sân bay & máy bay bay lên xuống rất thú vị nữa.","1. Khu vực bếp: không được như kỳ vọng. Không có bếp nấu & nồi. Đặc biệt không có kéo =>đáng lẽ mình cần sử dụng cái này nhiều trong khu vực bếp mà lại không có sẵn. Tôi đã kì vọng ở 1 căn bếp service apartment hơn như thế.
2. Thùng rác: Thùng rác không có nắp đậy khiến tôi không được thoải mái lắm. Ngoài ra không có thùng rác trong buồng wc, nếu muốn vứt rác phải cầm cục giấy đó vứt qua chỗ thùng dưới bồn rửa tay mới được. mà rác WC tôi cực kì mong muốn nó là thùng có nắp đậy.
3. Nội thất: Mặc dù thiết kế theo xu hướng tối ưu nhưng không được hoàn thiện tốt. Tôi đã phải nhờ dịch vụ kỹ thuật hỗ trợ khi cánh tủ kéo đóng không khít kiến đèn trong tủ nháy điên cuồng không tắt được. cánh tủ kéo cũng không được trơn mượt. Ngoài ra do sử dụng cửa lùa để ngăn phòng ngủ & phòng tắm nhưng lại sử dụng cửa lùa 1 ray trên nên cảm giác khi đóng mở chỉ sợ cửa nó trượt & tuột, cảm giác lỏng lẻo không chắc chắn. Ghế ngắm cảnh tại phòng khách được thiết kế rất ấn tượng, nhưng tôi có thể sờ được sự tách rời của lớp đệm bên dưới.
Tôi có lẽ là 1 khách hàng kỹ tính, nhưng rất mong KS có thể khắc phục được về mặt dịch vụ để xứng đáng với giá trị thương hiệu IHG mà tôi đã tin tưởng sử dụng."

Unfortunately I didn’t get to use the pool since I had to leave early, but it looks really nice!","It’s the first time where I checked into a room and there was no toilet paper. Definitely not very convenient when you realize it too late lol
Luckily there’s a phone in the bathroom so I was able to contact housekeeping and they dropped it off within minutes. 

Another thing that isn’t very convenient are the shuttle hours. The shuttle only comes every two hours and doesn’t run that late either. It was a little annoying having to wait that long after arriving from an international trip, but then again I could have just taken a taxi. Other SGN airport hotels offer free shuttle pick-ups on request which I found a lot more convenient. 
For that reason alone I would probably stay at another hotel the next time I’m in town."

In my room cleaning was not done properly. Cleaners did not empty one of the bins and didn’t replace 1 towel.

However, we learnt too late that the hotel does not provide any airport shuttle before 6:30AM. This information should be written explicitly on the main page. Otherwise, the hotel was helpful in booking a taxi for us to the airport."
Sam,Úc,8.0,"We stayed here one night only
While transiting through Saigon. It is close to airport so makes for easy and quick access (15-30 mins depending on traffic) and saves going into town. Rooms were small but very nice and clean. The pool is huge and the gym looked well equipped.

The best part of our stay was the buffet dinner (seafood for Moon Festival) and breakfast. The array of food was amazing - both western and eastern and very fresh and delicious. Staff were on hand to make/cook noodle soups/stirfry/eggs etc and understood dietary issues.  Kids are catered for with a play area, craft and fun food like popcorn, fairy floss and ice cream bar. There is also bags to take away fruit and bakery items for those travelling.  The staff are very nice and engaging. 

Check in/out process was easy. Note that to get back to the airport, you have to travel 5-10 mins away first before you can cross to the other direction so make sure to factor this into timings. There is a courtesy bus at set times or paid transfer provided by the hotel but we had already booked our own.",Nothing

The hotel advertised they offer free transportation to and from the airport which is the main reason I booked the accommodation for the convenience. 

It is misleading as the transfers ends at 2200 and the information the hotel provided which were two pictures that did not download so there were no written instructions to access the transfer.  I paid for my own transfers and the hotel staff was extremely nonchalant about the fact.  I paid for my taxi to the airport both ways.

Jeonghyun,Hàn Quốc,1.0,,"I previously left a positive review but have decided to update it. The reason for my initial positive review was:

When we checked out, we accidentally left a watch in the room. The staff were prompt and efficient in locating the watch and responding to us. We realised we had left the watch behind only when we were at the airport heading back to Australia. Since we couldn’t return to retrieve it, we contacted the hotel via email and arranged for the watch to be shipped internationally, covering the shipping cost ourselves.

Later, we were informed that due to the battery in the watch, international shipping would not be possible without an additional fee. Since I had a friend living in Vietnam, I asked for the watch to be sent to my friend’s workplace instead. Up until this point, the staff were helpful, responsive, and accommodating, which is why I initially left a positive review.

However, after I paid the international shipping fee, the hotel shipped the watch domestically within Vietnam instead, resulting in a price difference. They assured me they would refund the difference, but to this day, I have not received the refund. Multiple follow-up enquiries via email have gone unanswered for 4 WEEKS, and they do not answer calls either.

Had the final impression been as good as the initial one, this could have been a positive experience. Unfortunately, I am deeply disappointed and cannot recommend this hotel."

The room was perfect - lacked nothing - was clean as a whistle and on the quiet side of the building - just what I needed. Thank you Holiday Inn Ho Ci Minh City!",Nothing that I can think of.

Our plane was delayed meaning we lost 1 night of our booking but we were not charged even though we missed the cancellation deadline, that shows great customer service.","The variable rate jumped significantly from 1 day to the next depending on demand.

This place is a money grab and don't offer any value. This is a shame on the Holiday Inn franchise this is by farther worst branch. 5 star logo in the front door yet barely hits a 2 star ghettotel.

There's no basics provided in the room, hair dryer asked 2 times not provided.

I complained to the receptionist and this narcissistic bastard starts arguing with the customer.

IHG gonna have to investigate this place because no way they ever approved this.


Shuttle bus? Non existent it's all fake.

And the reply below is be some bullshit appologizing and that they gonna address the issue and what not, well they clearly did not address anything since we arrived here and experienced this.

They are full of crap and don't care about providing anything other than taking your money. It's $120 / night in a shit hole okay? Not expecting miracle's but the basics of a hotel.

So angry, will never come here and will not recommend. To the ground with this place and with the staff."

Location is easy to find and the fragrance they use in the lobby smells great.","- I checked in on my birthday and normally would expect a cake as a complimentary gift. However I didn't receive it here, as they said the cake should have been ordered beforehand, which is quite strange.
- I left a bottle of facial cleansing foam in the bathroom after check out and called them 30 mins later (around 12.30). Staff said that they would call me back as soon as they finish cleaning the room. 2 hours later, still no call whatsoever. I called them the second time at 2.30, they said that as soon as the cleaning team gives them information, they would get back to me. As I am writing this review at 3.20, still no information from them. Not sure if I would ever get my stuff back, but then again they should give me an exact call back time, not an absolutely vague answer like ""we'll call back at some point in the future"" as having a look at the bathroom doesn't take much of their time either.
- Room 1032 at the time of my check in had no bathrobes. First call, one was delivered. Second call, another one. It feels a bit weird as we checked in as a couple and 2 bathrobes in the room is the norm anyway..."

Quatre mois après le paiement, ma carte avait été remplacée par ma banque, et je ne l'avais donc pas sur moi: il m'a été demandé de retrouver mes relevés bancaires indiquant que j'avais bien été débitée, alors que l'hôtel disposait du ticket du crédit! Une requête très désagréable et surtout totalement injustifiée, jamais exigée dans un autre hôtel au Viêtnam en 2 semaines de voyage. Après que je me sois énervée au bout de 15mn, les réceptionnistes ont finalement laissé tomber. A noter aussi que la chambre était réservée depuis 4 mois pour 3 adultes: les femmes de chambre ne sont montées préparer le 3è lit qu'après notre prise de possession de la chambre, alors qu'il aurait été plus logique d'avoir préparé ce lit en amont, entre le check out des précédents occupants et notre arrivée tardive."

3. Поселили одну семью на 2 разных этажа, дав по одному ключу. Мы не могли попасть в номер к детям, нужно было телепортироваться или спускаться на ресепшен, чтобы попросить второй ключ в час ночи. Лифт везет вас только на ваш этаж.
4. В отеле 5* нам дали рваную простынь и пододеяльник с пятном крови и другими пятнами непонятного происхождения. Наволочка была грязная. Видимо, стирают здесь белье на очень низких температурах. От подушки был неприятный запах. Это дно. Это уровень дешевой ночлежки. 
5. В номер заселилось 2 человека, но тапочки и косметические принадлежности были только на одного человека. Дозвониться до ресепшен, службе по работе с гостями, консьержу мы не смогли, так как нигде не взяли трубку.

Wer also näher am Geschehen dran sein möchte, sollte dieses Hotel nicht nehmen. Das Frühstück war reichhaltig und gut.","Im Grunde genommen ist es einfach kein 5-Sterne-Hotel. Die Dinge, die uns gestört haben, waren zwar alles nur Kleinigkeiten, aber in der Summe war es dann doch etwas anstrengend und nicht zufriedenstellend. Bei unserer Ankunft haben zwei Concierges zugeschaut, wie wir uns mit vier schweren Rucksäcken abgeschleppt haben. Das haben wir in 3-Sterne-Hotels in Vietnam wesentlich anders erlebt! Beim Check-In wurde uns nicht gesagt, wann das Frühstück ist. In unserem Zimmer war das Bettlaken zerrissen und die Decke hatte einen Fleck. Nachdem wir uns beschwert haben, wurde es zwar direkt ausgetauscht, aber dennoch: sowas geht einfach nicht. Teilweise standen im Flur tagelang die Tabletts vom Zimmerservice herum und wurden nicht weggeräumt. Von solchen Dingen gab es viele. Manch einer würde vielleicht sagen, dass das Meckern auf hohem Niveau ist, aber von einem 5-Sterne-Hotel erwarte ich sowas nicht.

Another thing we loved was coming in and seeing the cafe full of students hanging out as though it was their own living room- this place has a great homey feel! The smell of coffee wafting up the stairs was an added bonus too! When they give you recommendations for local eats- they were also some of the best and most memorable of our whole trip too!

The room had quite a few windows overlooking neighbours' rooftop gardens, so you could choose to watch that or roll down the blinds. I've really enjoyed staying there. The place is located in a relatively quiet area which is still cental enough to walk to most places you'd be interested to see. It's not facing the main road (but is just around the corner), so it feels very peaceful. Thank you for the pleasant stay!",

Adrian,Úc,9.0,"Light, spacious, modern and tastefully decorated room. A quiet haven in the heart of the street craziness that is Saigon.",Minor quibbles. The bed was a little too firm for ageing joints. The TV was a non-event unless you had a Samsung account for screen sharing or prepared to enter your YouTube or Netflix login details. Wifi was occasionally patchy. All very minor inconveniences
Ollie&rach,Vương Quốc Anh,10.0,"Amazing welcome, fantastic staff, we arrived late at night and still had recommendations of where to eat at 11pm! Room was really comfy, bed, pillows etc. location was perfect, just enough out of the tourist area to eat and drink with locals but close enough for all the sights. Nice decor, cafe downstairs really cute, far enough from main street to not hear any noise at night. Free drinks and snacks in the room, you get a free drink with your stay from the cafe too and the coffee was really good. 24 HR security and always there to open the door for you so you don't have to worry about complex locking procedures or opening hours coming back later at night. Wish we'd had longer here! It was pretty much perfect!","Shower was a strange layout with the narrowest bit under the shower head, I'm a big guy and could fit but not much room, same for the towels, the biggest one available didn't quite cover me! Would have been really nice to have a free coffee each day as there's a cafe right downstairs. This is me being really picky because as you can see from the rating, everything was really fantastic."
Leonhard,Pháp,10.0,"All around excellent stay. Best hotel I’ve stayed at in Vietnam. Super clean, beautiful architecture, spacious room, safe neighborhood. The staff really went out of their way to make my stay as amazing as possible, by being available for questions via WhatsApp at any time and providing a host of fantastic recommendations at my every request. 
Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone coming to Vietnam to do the same.",

The cafe downstairs is lovely and serves great coffee.

It is in an excellent location in District 1 to walk to places for food and shopping.

Wayne,Hồng Kông,10.0,"This was one of my favourite places that I stayed during my travels around Vietnam. For urban living it was perfect; it is just a 5 minutes Grab ride from Saigon Railway Station, 20 minutes Grab ride from Tan Son Nhat International Airport, and within comfortable walking distance to the War Remnants Museum and many other points of interest within District 1. I am especially grateful to the manager, Bao, for allowing me to check in extra early (for a small fee) after my overnight sleeper train that arrived in Ho Chi Minh at 4:00AM. It was such a beautiful room and everything I needed after a long train journey. I was particularly impressed by the interior design which looks chic, modern and clean and the room was well-organised with all the amenities. A small but important detail – I appreciated fitted bed sheets for the bed! The homestay is situated just a tiny distance from the street so it's central while still being quiet and peaceful.",

Gabrielle,Canada,10.0,"This is the best hotel I've been to in Vietnam. It is definitely more on the expensive side by Vietnamese standards, but you totally get what you're paying for (and I liked it better than other 4* hotels I went to afterwards). 

Rooms are very modern and clean, bed is very comfortable, bathroom was super. The manager Bao is a sweetheart and was VERY helpful with helping me with reservations. They were nice enough to let me shower in a room after I had checked out (before getting a night bus) for no extra charge, which I truly appreciated.

The café downstairs is very pleasant and drinks are tasty. There is always someone at the café to open up the door for you (24h).","Noise coming from outside early in the morning (BUT there was construction nearby and generally soundproofing isn't great in Vietnamese hotels, so it's very minor)."

They also give us a list of food to try in the area which was wonderful as this is our first time in Vietnam

Cindy,Mexico,10.0,"Adding my voice to the choir, this hotel is great and staff are lovely. The room is spacious and had lots of natural light.

Lynne,Úc,10.0,"Loved everything about this homestay. The room was large,bright, and airy. The coffee shop on the ground floor made exceptional coffee. I highly recommend trying their Vietnamese white coffee made with 6 different milks. Delicious!
The two brothers who run the Leiden could not have been more welcoming and were very happy to give food recommendations, book taxis recommend sites to see etc. Bao   even put his own football app on the TV in our room so my husband could watch his weekend game.
The location is great being in District 1 but being down a lane way, you are away from the chaotic traffic noise of Saigon.

Lucy,Vương Quốc Anh,10.0,"We loved our stay. When we arrived we foolishly didn't have cash to pay our Grab taxi (we thought we'd paid on card) and the hotel staff sorted it out for us immediately, without question.

The hotel felt like a little oasis away from the city, yet it was well placed and walking distance to everything we wanted to see. We would definitely stay again.",
Weytmans,New Zealand,10.0,"Both Bao and Huy and their support staff are extremely friendly, without overdoing it. Their English is also very good.

Everything (besides cleanliness) was better than we expected.","Cleanliness - a lot of someone's hairs in bathroom, quite dirty showerglass, bathroomswalls, fronts of cabinets, doors, unironed bed linens and with spots...  If the owners will work on cleanliness - everything will be perfect then."
El,United Arab Emirates (Các Tiểu Vương Quốc Ả Rập Thống Nhất),10.0,Loved the cleanliness and the cosy atmosphere! It was full on Christmas vibes and definitely home away from home. The location is central and super convenient and the building is super new!,

2) serve/offer some kind of breakfast."

So friendly and helpful with anything needed from start to finish - from food recommendations to tourist attractions, tours, etc. The cafe below the homestay is beautiful and serves great coffee and pastries. I was in the Anna room - absolutely huge room, lovely comfortable bed and new furnishings, tv with Netflix. Bathroom had great features and amazing water pressure. Probably the best place I’ve stayed while travelling around South East Asia. Location is great, near enough to all the attractions that you can walk while also being in a quiet neighbourhood away from the noise - made sleeping a joy! The only downside is that my stay had to come to an end! Looking forward to coming back at some point for great service and a great stay.",

Kellie,Úc,10.0,"This hotel is fantastic.  On arrival, we were so delighted with the sweet, charming appearance of a well built, beautifully fit-out hotel, tucked down a nice quiet alley way.  As soon as we entered the building, we knew we would be very comfortable here.  The family room is huge!  Enough space to completely stretch out.  We only had one night in transit but we would easily stay longer.  There are plenty of places to eat nearby and places to have a drink or a coffee and just go exploring.  The owners of the hotel were extremely lovely and couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a base in Ho Chi Min City.  The signature coffee is a must!",

Catarina,Bồ Đào Nha,10.0,"We are a couple in our early to late 40s, 3 weeks traveling in Vietnam, all with several great stays. Nevertheless, this was the best, really the best. Best comfort, cleanliness, communication, design, aesthetics. ease of talking with host.... even the little details: charcoal toothpaste, bamboo toothbrushes, choice of lightening on each corner of our beautiful room, and on it goes. Do try their Leiden signature coffee (made with 7 types of milk!) and exquisite teas, wonderful!",
Elliott,Úc,9.0,"Our hosts here were so friendly from the moment we arrived. They messaged us with food recommendations (which we used and loved!), and the welcome drink in their cafe downstairs was a lovely touch. The location is great, because you're just far enough away from the main street to have peace and quiet, but in only a few steps from the accommodation you're back in the hustle and bustle! The room was recently renovated and was very clean and inviting. It truly was the best place to begin our Vietnam trip.",
Will,Úc,10.0,"The charm of Leiden Homestay is considerable. First of all, the staff are exceptionally nice. You get a welcome coffee free of charge upon arrival. The colour scheme and overall ambience of the place is very pleasing to the eye. The room itself is great with enough of a carpeted area to do exercises, a great shower, air conditioning and coffee. The location of the hotel is awesome, within walking distance of cafes, restaurants, Ben Thanh market and of course it isn't far from the airport.",That I didn't put enough of a tip in when it came to payment haha 😂
Aqhari,Singapore,10.0,"Firstly, the property was strategically located in district 1, close to all the attractions nearby. The property was designed to consist of a dutch theme whereby the rooms are named after certain cities and moreover it was well furnished, maintained and new! The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was stunning. Rooms are equipped with a smart tv with Netflix and Amazon so that is definitely a plus! The owners both brothers Bao and Huy are super amazing and friendly! They would provide local recommendations for spots to eat and venture around town! What completed my stay was the warmth hospitality by them from the welcome speciality coffee to the little handmade souvenir keychain given as a token of appreciation for choosing to stay at Leiden! Overall, it was an exceptional stay and i would definitely recommend Leiden to friends and family! Thanks Bao and Huy! You guys are definitely the best!",Nothing.
Lieke,Hà Lan,10.0,"One of the best hotels during our holiday of 3 weeks in Vietnam. The hosts are so friendly and helpful. We felt very welcome. The room (Anna) was great, spacious, nice decorate and clean. We enjoyed the shower and the bed. Also, the hotel is well located. Everything you want to see in HCM is nearby, maximum 15 mins walk.

It was so nice to have lounge space as well as the dining area, and the 2 bathrooms were great. Leiden staff were friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make our stay a positive experience. 
The location in District 1 is great. Many places we wanted to visit were an easy walk. After a day out, our kids really appreciated the Playstation and the smart TV - a nice way to end the day.","Not a drawback, but do note that Leiden Homestay is tucked back in an alley, so if you arrive by car you'll need to be dropped on the main street and then walk to the hotel. It's an easy walk and they will help you with luggage if needed. (This location point is actually a pro as it keeps things quiet.)"

Fionnuala,Ireland (Ai Len),9.0,The room was really clean and the staff were so lovely and helpful. The cafe downstairs is really nice and the welcome drinks were a lovely touch.

Otherwise everything was perfect!
Sam,Tây Ban Nha,10.0,"Leiden Homestay and café was the perfect place for us to stay in Saigon. It is close walk to the fun parts of District One.

After 2 weeks of Vietnamese breakfast we were craving croissants!"
Van,Thụy Sỹ,10.0,"We enjoyed our stay at Leiden Homestay a lot for many reasons: Beautifully designed room in good size with lots of natural light, very clean and practical details like a luggage rack and clothes hangers. Quite nights due to the location in a back alley (follow the sign), yet super central.

Sean,Canada,10.0,"Modern rooms in a new building. Tucked into a back alley for added privacy and intimacy. Hosts did everything they could to make sure we could find the things we wanted in Ho Chi Minh.

We had nine full days at the property and it was honestly just fantastic! 👍

Good shower, Netflix on the tv, great big windows, great furniture, delicious coffee on the property. Ok that's it.","There are some noisey things going on sometimes, but short of being in a windowless box I don't think you can get away from that in District 1.

Munro,Vương Quốc Anh,9.0,The property is great. A very clean room that is nicely furnished and the owners could not have been more helpful.

Mark,Vương Quốc Anh,8.0,"Location was great, comfortable bed and good shower.

Patricia,Singapore,9.0,"The rooms were big, fresh, and new with furnishings. It felt more like an apartment than a hotel. It’s also quiet even during the day since it’s slightly tucked away from the main road.

The best part of our stay however was the welcoming atmosphere and the relaxed vibes of the Café / common area.
The young hosts, two brothers, could not have been any more friendly or helpful!

Anna,Đức,10.0,"The rooms are super stylish, everything is very modern. It was super bright with many windows. Furniture and decoration are very well chosen. The beds are super comfy.
They reduce plastic wast by using dispensers for soap and shower gel, offering bamboo tooth brushes, using paper straws and take away cups. 
The three brothers are extremely nice, helpful and always up for a chat. We could easily leave our luggage with them over the day, they gave us advise on restaurants and places to eat as well as anything else we needed.
Their cafe in the bottom part of the hotel is really beautiful, they obviously know a lot about coffee and their drinks are awesome!",
Alisa,Đức,10.0,"We‘ve been to Vietnam for the first time and as soon as we saw Leiden Homestay & cafe we immediately chose to book it and it was the best decision we ever made. When we arrived the whole family greeted us and both brothers helped us settle in our hotel room. We also could choose a free drink from their cafe and you definitely have to check out the Vietnamese white coffee, it was so good that we ordered it nearly every day. The room itself was so cozy, really clean and so stylish that we always loved coming home after a really busy day in the city. Whenever we had a question or needed to book a trip or a taxi they immediately helped us out and everything was settled so easily! We also got a full pdf with so many amazing restaurants and recommendations that we would have totally missed out on otherwise. The stay is also in the middle of the city, there are many supermarkets nearby, the ben thanh market as well as the ho thi ky flower market with an amazing streetfood market next to it can be reached by foot!

Tipvipa,Thái Lan,10.0,"Super cosy family owned homestay that goes extra miles to help you with anything. 

The room we stayed in (Hattem) is spacious and has got everything we needed. The bedding is so comfortable and the bed is great size for tall travellers. My hubby usually has issue staying in accommodation in Asia as he’s 1.95cm but he slept just fine here. 

Location is in the heart of the city but away from noisy main road as cars cannot enter the alley Leiden is situated in. Downstairs, they run a small cafe where we could get tasty coffee and other drinks offered anytime of the day! We could choose to enjoy our drink at the cafe itself or served in room. 

Upon our arrival, we were offered a welcome drink which we could choose from their in house menu and when we left we also received a ‘Hattem’key chain as a souvenir.

During our stay, we also kept getting tips and local recommendations via WhatsApp from Bảo the owner which was amazing! 

We would like to thank Hui, Bao and the team again for warm welcome and for looking after us during our stay. Leiden, a place that is more than just a homestay!",Our stay ended too soon!
Zenia,Mỹ,10.0,"Leiden is the first homestay I’ve ever stayed in, and I had the best experience. 

Responsiveness 

Before departing, I was worried I wouldn’t get a visa to enter Vietnam on time, but Huy - one of the hosts - helped me through the process. Ultimately, I was given the visa by the government in time, but Huy was so responsive, and for that, I’m grateful. 

The hosts also could help make reservations if you don’t have a local Vietnamese number. They are very fluent in English as well. Highly recommend! 

Accommodations 

Leiden is a beautiful place to stay. It is newly built, affordable, clean and centrally located in District 1. It’s also convenient to have a cafe as part of the homestay. We drank coffee from the downstairs cafe every day. The homestay is decorated like the Netherlands, with each room called a location from there. I really love the minimalist style with pops of red colour. The bed is comfy, and the shower is refreshing. They provide you with toothbrushes, toothpaste and a hamper for your laundry. They also provide biscuits in case you are hungry and some tea. I also loved the full length mirror so I could look my best during my stay. 

All in all, a great place and will recommend to all my Singaporean friends to stay there.","To get to the rooms, you will need to
climb two flights of stairs before using the elevator or lift. For those with mobility issues, this may be a challenge."
Stefan,Đức,9.0,"Nice location in a backstreet, situated above a cafe. Both, the homestay and the cafe are run by two vietnamese brothers. They are super nice, give you great recommendations about where to eat, drink etc. They also make very ""White Coffee"" - try it!",Nothing on which the could have any influence :)
Annabella,Brunei Darussalam (Brunây),10.0,"Leiden Homestay & Cafe was truly one of the highlights of our trip. The place was clean, cozy and beautifully designed.

The true charm of this property is the hospitality provided by the hosts. As a family business, it is primarily managed by two brothers, both of whom went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and easy as possible. For eg: we had gotten lost on our way there our first night and they had gotten on their bike to come find us and lead us to their place. My boyfriend also enjoyed speaking to the older brother as they both shared an interest in coffee - he even made us egg coffee because we hadn’t tried any and later gave my boyfriend a cleaning tool for his machine! 

I honestly would come back to this place because I felt well taken care of and I will definitely recommend this place to others.","nothing, a true 10/10 for me"

Leiden Homestay is just perfect: It’s located within walking distance to all places of interest in HCMC (both bars/restaurants and sights), but very quiet nevertheless. The building itself is outstanding. It is a beautiful and freshly renovated old building with brick walls and stylish interior with modern design and great comfort. One can really see that they decorated with love and dedication to detail. The rooms offer everything you could wish for. But the best about Leiden definitely is the family itself. We felt very welcome and better than home from the first second. We got a list with great recommendations (e.g. vegetarian restaurants) and helpful info for our ongoing trip. They also serve great coffee (try their white coffee!). We just loved everything about it and would love to come back when we’re going to Vietnam again.",

We where not prepared for this which was a struggle as we needed to get to the airport in time. But they told us, that they will have card payment soon. 

No room service during our stay. We needed to go to the reception to ask for more toilet paper which isn't really a cool thing to do. Also they didn't clean the trash bin during our stay nor gave us new towels. Service could be better for the price. 

Dog barking for hours every evening. It's not the hotels fault but however it was very annoying."

Ilshat,Nga,10.0,"Literally everything:
- the hotel is brand new with all new and stylish furniture, comfortable bed, fresh linen and towels, huge smart TV with Netflix;
- high-speed Wi-Fi, excellent for for remote work; 
- many of lights that you can adjust to your mood;
- very friendly stuff who eager to meet all your needs;
- located in the central district with many cafes just a walking distance (we didn’t use a taxi, cause it’s about 20 min walk to the main attractions)
- close to the airport;
- welcome drink on arrival was a pleasant surprise ☺️

Overall, definitely recommend this place 👍🏻",-

Irina,Pháp,10.0,"A brand-new homestay, the facilities are beautiful, sparkling clean and designed with great love. You feel that the owners' family really care about their guests. A free welcome drink, real French croissants for breakfast on demand, any kinds of recomendations or services by whatsap or at the reception and attention to every request or possible need. 

Beds were super comfy, bed sheets and towels were all new. As the homestay is not on the main street, it's quiet. The only noise you may hear from outside is a dog barking or local kids playing. The location is very central but not too touristic, so you can enjoy seeing some local life. 

The young managers speak English and are experts in local coffee. The ground floor is their coffee shop where you can try probably best farmers' Robusta in Vietnam, and also buy a freshly ground pack with you. We also had a chance to meet the whole family together, so we really had very nice people, and the grandfather spoke French with us. 

Definitely recommend it!",

Anna,Ba Lan,10.0,"Hotel jest położony w bocznej uliczce, dzięki czemu jest w nim cicho. Budynek w stylu kamienicy pozytywnie wyróżnia się na tle innych zabudowań. Lokalizacja jest dogodna do zwiedzania (10 minut do Bui Vien Street czy 20 minut do War Remnants Museum). Pokój jest pięknie urządzony i przestronny, dzięki czemu można było zostawić klimatyzację włączoną na noc (była nad wejściem do pokoju, a nie nad łóżkiem) bez ryzyka przeziębienia. Łożko spore, poduszki i kołdra przyjemne. Materac twardy (dla mnie za bardzo, ale to kwestia osobistych preferencji), najtwardszy ze wszystkich moich noclegów, ale poza tym dobrej jakości i dobrze się wyspałam przez tę 1 noc. Łazienka ładna i czysta. Widać, że wystrój całego pokoju był bardzo przemyślany i dopracowany. Ponadto personel świetnie mówi po angielsku i był bardzo pomocny podczas naszego pobytu. Dostaliśmy rekomendacje jedzeniowe i skorzystaliśmy z polecanej lokalnej restauracji ze śniadaniem typu Broken Rice - było bardzo smaczne.
Był to jeden z naszych ostatnich noclegów w Wietnamie i przenieśliśmy się do niego z innego miejsca, głośniejszego i w mniej zadbanej okolicy. Hotel ten zrobił bardzo dobre wrażenie. Szczególnie, że Sajgon okazał się zupełnie innym i bardziej przytłaczającym miastem niż się spodziewaliśmy (a trochę już widzieliśmy). Zdecydowanie warto dopłacić do lepszego noclegu, żeby po intensywnych wrażeniach móc zamknąć drzwi w cichym, czystym, wygodnym miejscu i odpocząć od sporego zgiełku, który jest na zewnątrz.",

Ils ont été très attentionnés et nous ont donné des conseils et bonnes adresses pour profiter pleinement de notre séjour à Ho-Chi-Minh. La chambre est spacieuse et très propre. Ce Homestay est adapté aux européens qui cherchent le confort habituel et sans trop de dépaysement. De plus leurs cafés sont très bons !,"Les chambres ne sont pas très bien isolées de l’escalier et les murs pas vraiment efficaces quand quelqu’un parle fort dans la chambre voisine.

Katrine,Đan Mạch,9.0,"Sikke et fint sted! Familiedrevet lille hotel i en sidegade — skønt at bo hvor byens indbyggere også bor! Vi var i SAigon i to omgange, første gang boede vi på stort hotel, på 42. etage, så det her var noget helt andet. Fint indrettet og meget søde ejere, der tilbød hjælp og vejledning og i det hele taget tog sig godt af os. Stille beliggenhed, men vær indstillet på at blive vækket af en hane eller to om morgenen (det bidrager bare til charmen). Ejerne har også en café og laver super dejlig kaffe, især deres vietnamesiske milk coffee var skøn. Og gode drinks også. Og dertil kommer en yderst lav værelsespris — det her er virkelig value for money.","Vi fik ikke gjort rent på vores værelse, men da vi kun havde to nætter der gjorde det ikke så meget. Ellers intet at beklage, alt var virkelig fint."

Christoph,Đức,10.0,"Die beste Unterkunft, die man sich in Saigon vorstellen kann! Das kleine Homestay / Bed&Breakfast ist nagelneu und eine kleine Oase im ansonsten sehr trubeligen Saigon! Zentral gelegen in Distrikt 1 und doch ruhig in einer kleinen Seitenstraße (neben GUTA-Café in der Hauptstraße die kleine Seitenstraße reinlaufen). Unten ein Café, in dem man sehr leckeren Kaffee bekommt! Oben die insgesamt 5 Zimmer. Die Zimmer sind groß und extrem geschmackvoll eingerichtet! Die Betten sind der Hammer (sehr gute Matratzen, tolle Bettwäsche), alles ist super sauber und neu. Die Zimmer haben große Fernseher mit Netflix/Prime/Youtube-Möglichkeit und überall gibt es schnelles und kostenfreies Internet. Ich habe mich rundum sehr sehr wohl gefühlt! Das Homestay wird von zwei sehr gastfreundlichen Brüdern geführt, die sich sehr darum bemühen, den Aufenthalt so angenehm und komfortabel wie möglich zu machen! Ich vergebe eigentlich nie 10 Punkte (irgendwas ist ja meistens doch noch zu verbessern :)) - hier sind 10 Punkte aber mehr als angemessen! Wer also einen Wohlfühlort in Saigon sucht und nicht in einem anonymen 08/15-Hotel absteigen möchte, sollte unbedingt hier buchen! Und bitte seid nett zu den beiden Besitzern, das haben sie verdient! ;)",Für mich war es perfekt…!

,Nga,10.0,"Гостеприимство, с которым здесь встречают гостей поражает! Нас буквально окружили заботой с первого дня. Угощали вкусными фруктами и мясом, приглашали играть в настольные игры и постоянно интересовались все ли у нас хорошо и нужны ли помощь.
На выезде по нашей карте не сработала оплата и ребята согласились принять оплату в долларах. Потому что мы очень спешили в аэропорт. Нам любезно помогли донести чемоданы до дороги и погрузить их в такси.
Номера все новенькие, мебель и техника в них свежая. Очень удобные кровати и подушки. Постельное и полотенца чистые и свежие. По запросу меняют их и убирают в номере.

Simon,Úc,8.0,Great for the airport,Felt a little dated
Frank,Hàn Quốc,9.0,"Phenomenal deal: for a low price you get an elite room with pool and sauna and gym access. Like living in an apartment. You feel like a resident, and are surrounded by more permanent residents. Easy to shop for food and cook in the apartment if staying longterm.","The location's far from the city center. Good if you're visiting the airport often, since it's only a 5-minute walk.
Feels a little out of the way, and the nearby restaurants cater more to local Vietnamese than to tourists."
Anjum,Vương Quốc Anh,7.0,"Response by hosts is immediate 24/7. Great location, apartment, with staff on site 24/7. 
Clean and well equipped apartment, very comfortable, thank you.",The only thing was the electric sockets are not working in the bedroom or around the apartment.

I guess if I had to mention anything, it is the distance to the city center, but the reason for staying here is to be close to the airport."
Sarah,New Zealand,9.0,I needed to book something quick as I wasn’t allowed to board my flight and this is within walking distance. You can walk straight from the airport and they have everything you need. Was a short stay but very large for a place in vietnam. Would totally recommend if you need somewhere near the airport. More expensive than town prices but when you need a place it’s perfect.,"Nothing really I obviously only booked it for ease of location. It is very standard check in they don’t really help with with anything, internet Wi-Fi etc."
Graham,Hà Lan,9.0,"Very nice, comfortable hotel. If you have an early flight, or multiple flights and hcmc is your base, then this serviced apartment hotel is ideal. An easy walk to airport... about 15 to 20 minutes, but with luggage it is better to take a grab taxi. Not even 5 minutes. Room was very clean. Actually, I stayed 3 times in this hotel. Each time was perfect. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. They even helped me to arrange a motorbike to use while I was staying there (I lived 5 years in HCMC and had a lot of experience with driving in the traffic. If first time,be very careful if you want to drive a motorcycle here. Grab motorbikes are very cheap and are probably a better option). All in all... a great place to stay if you need to be close to the airport. ATM, small convenience stores, and coffee places and restaurants all within 5 minutes walk.","Nothing really that i didnt like. Just a couple of minor points. On one stay, I had a room which had some small cockroaches in it. May have been bought in with someones luggage. When I reported it, the staff immediately sprayed the room and moved me to another room where there were none. Problem solved.
On the 10th floor, 10.07, the water took some time to heat up. But this was not a problem... in the Saigon heat, a cooler shower is often preferred...🙂 
It is far from the center, District 1, and traffic can be very slow. But still not a big problem..."

The apartments are modern and spacious enough, with a good standard of fixtures and fittings. They have a living room and a bedroom. The L shaped sofa could be used as a bed at a push.
Checking in and out was easy.
I felt it was a little pricey for what it was, but I guess you pay for the location and the high turnover of short stays.","A balcony would have been nice, other than that nothing to grumble about."

There are plenty of bars and restaurants in the area as well as in the airport itself (landside).  It is too far out of town to stay unless you are flying out but it sure is value for money.",All was good.
Kimberly,Canada,7.0,"Walking distance to the airport but instant culture shock! There is a back road that makes it easier to get there but google maps took us to the main road where there were no side walks so we were walking against traffic.

Quiet with pleasant outlook to gardens and the pool.",We were in transit with almost no VND currency with us. Not worth the ATM fees for a layover.

Karina,Úc,8.0,quick stop over before flight,walking distance to airport
Petrus,Hà Lan,9.0,"A great apartment to stay at, before or after a long journey. Walking to the airport is no problem, even with luggage. It's best to use the east gate, not the main gate, because it's much shorter and avoids all traffic outside. Got some exercise at the swimming pool and gym. Around the hotel is also where a lot of taxis gather for the airport, so transport is no problem.

The room wasn't cleaned when we arrived, but that was immediately solved by giving us another room by the friendly staff.","If immediately after your arrival, you'd like to join the HCMC nightlife, then you probably want to head downtown. If HCMC is just a stopover, this is perfect.
Although there was plenty of food options outside available, if you want to sit down in a nice restaurant, then you probably want to get an Uber or one of the 100 taxis outside."

Mirjam,United Arab Emirates (Các Tiểu Vương Quốc Ả Rập Thống Nhất),10.0,"The apartment was gorgeous. A real haven in the craziness of Ho Chi Minh City. I had an early flight the next day so wanted to be walking distance from the airport to avoid having to take a taxi and the stress of having to haggle. It's a 5 minute walk when you follow the directions given by the hotel. It doesn't involve having to walk on the road with a bit of traffic which can feel a little scary. Once your in through the gate though, you just walk through the parking lot and the terminal is 200m away. Facilities are great considering the price and there are convenience shops and plenty of restaurants around. Make sure you stock up there before going into the airport as the prices in the airport are ridiculous. You just can't bring liquids. 

Receptionist was very lovely and it was no problem to check in an hour early. It was clean. I saw some complaints about the air-conditioning being not strong. There is a power setting on the remote you can press to make it more powerful and after an hour it was nice and cold in there.",Nothing. It was great
Alex,Vương Quốc Anh,10.0,"The apartment was super clean, had a comfy bed, was well sound proofed and large with great facilities including pool and sauna.",Not their fault but Google Maps took us on a bad route to find it. Make sure you check your route before.
Stephanie,Úc,5.0,"Convenient location, open 24 hrs, easy check in.","The shower reeked of urine, the air conditioning didn't work very well and it was extremely hot all night.

Christophe,Pháp,10.0,"The property was really incredible as usual, it’s not my first time in this place.

I will come back again :

Bed was comfortable and it was very quiet considering it is next to the airport! Also good options for food locally as well, you don’t have to venture far for amenities.","We booked it as we thought we could walk to the property from the airport, you can walk and we did but it was a bit tricky but probably because we were delayed so landed late in the evening. However there is a taxi rank outside the front door so we got a taxi back to the airport which was very cheap"

I was at first concerned about the quality of accommodation here because of all the reviews on various places but Blue Sky serviced apartments were lovely, clean, quiet and easily accessed.   Large comfy beds, quiet, airconditioned rooms, kitchen, and everything you needed.","The only thing I can think of is that we were told the pool would close at 9pm and we got ready to go for a quick dip, but the pool attendant then told us it closes at 8:30 and we had just got there at 8:25 and it was too late."

Then, there’s no longer any soap and sponge for cleaning up and no soap in shower room. Small savings, indeed. However, location can’t be beat for overnight stays before leaving country.",See above.
Denis,Pháp,10.0,We only stayed for 8 hours while waiting for a flight connection but found the Blue Sky Apartments to be ideal for our needs and only wish we could have stayed longer.

Из-за месторасположения таксисты не хотят связываться (мы с 2мя детьми, один из них младенец и кучей багажа не хотели идти пешком, но пришлось), найти дорогу к отелю не просто, несмотря на то, что он рядом. Везде забор и непонятно куда идти. Я написала заранее вопрос о том, как добраться и мне посоветовали заказать grab, водители которого не хотели соглашаться.

Мы останавливались на пол дня, точнее на ночь. Очень удобный матрас и подушки, бесшумный кондиционер. Удалось восстановить силы перед следующим перелетом. Но мне бы хотелось задержаться там подольше.

Christophe,Pháp,10.0,"L'emplacement est parfait, il se situe à 5 minutes à pied de l'aéroport. Pas besoin de payer un taxi ou un Grab pour s'y rendre : c'est inutile.
C'est à mon sens l'endroit idéal pour une longue escale, préparer son arrivée ou son départ (1 nuit ou 2) avant ou après.
1) Les chambres : elles sont spacieuses, propres et certaines avec une vue sur l'aéroport. Elles disposent d'une cuisine, salon et grande douche : très appréciable pour se relaxer.
2) L'équipement extérieur : Il est suffisant car vous disposez d'un SPA avec massage, salle de sport et piscine privée.
3) Le quartier : L'endroit est calme, il y a le Menas Mall à proximité avec plusieurs restaurants. On peut y trouver aussi de la street food, et de bon ""Pho"" en bas de l'hôtel. Il n'est pas nécessaire de commander un Grab Food car tout est à proximité.
4) Le personnel : L'équipe est sympathique, avenante et à l'écoute. Un grand merci à toutes et tous pour votre professionnalisme. La prochaine fois, je ramène des chocolats pour vous remercier.
5) Les décorations de noël : L'équipe a fait un réel effort pour embellir le lieu, aussi bien à l'extérieur qu'à l'intérieur. C'est féerique en cette période de fin d'année. L'endroit est approprié si vous avez des enfants.
6) Il faut le dire, les autres hôtels de la place ne sont pas aussi bien pour le même prix.

Avec mon épouse, nous avons beaucoup apprécié cet endroit et pour ma part j'ai admiré la vue sur les avions qui décollent de l'aéroport. Pas d'inquiétude au niveau sonore car même si l'hôtel y est très proche, vous n'entendrez rien et vous pourrez dormir tranquillement.
Petit plus, les serviettes et le nécessaire pour la toilette est disponible (savon pour les mains, le corps, le shampoing, brosse à dent et dentrifrice, ...).

Je recommande vivement.",

The hotel looks quite old, and the facilities are neither clean nor well-maintained. It’s difficult to understand how this property has received such a high rating. The bed is hard, the pillows are uncomfortable, and the bathroom also shows signs of age and wear. Additionally, the staff provides a rather average service, which feels below what one might reasonably expect from a 3-star hotel.

If you’re planning to stay just one or two days and primarily need a place to sleep, this hotel might be an option, considering the budget. However, for those seeking a more comfortable and enjoyable experience, I would not recommend this hotel."
