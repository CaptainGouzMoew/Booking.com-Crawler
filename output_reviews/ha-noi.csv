2. Staffs have a very good services mind and helpful. 🥰
3. Good for family and a group of friends trip. Hotel have family room 3-4 people in one room.👍🏻
4. Got a big space inside the room.👍🏻
5. Comfortable bed, soft and clean. No back pain😄
6. Pho at hotel’s cafeteria have a good taste. 😋","1. Hotel should inform or note down on booking website that guest have to pay cash when arrive at the hotel. If pay by card (any type of card) will have 3% charge. In case some guests didn’t bring enough cash…like me😅 
Because when I booked the hotel on booking.com I want to pay immediately, already put credit card information I thought I paid via credit card already but in the end when arrived reception informed me about payment detail.
So… I have to pay by card bc cash not enough. 

2. If the cleanliness is improved just a bit more, this place will be perfect. And I suggest to have some diffuser inside the room for guest to feel more relax."

Lilibeth,Philippines,10,"Before coming, there was an issue about early check-in, so I thought that was a red flag, but on the day of my arrival, the manager had a room made up so I could check-in early (10:30). From there, things went on smoothly. The cleaning ladies were nice. The reception staff was helpful. I stayed here for 5d/4N. On my second day, all the mattresses at the 3rd flr (and maybe other floors, too), were replaced with brand new ones,   I was even allowed to take a shower when I came back in the afternoon after I had checked out. I will stay at this hotel again when I visit Hanoi, which I usually do. Thank you, La Passion Classic Hotel guys.",The food choices at the buffet breakfast remained the same everyday.
Jeewakarathna,Sri Lanka,10,"Staff were superb and very supportive. Specially Mr. Tom and Mr. Alex. Breakfast was too tasty and with lots of options. Though the Restaurant was bit small, staff managed to serve ALL in good way.

On the first one, we got a suite without the sofa and the cigarettes can be seen outside the glass window, which was annoying."

Ariza,United Arab Emirates (Các Tiểu Vương Quốc Ả Rập Thống Nhất),9,"Breakfast is enjoyable, but it could be even better with some variety everyday. I like the coffee so much and the dry noodles, but the pho is a big no for me it has some weird taste maybe because of the coriander though I havent tried the original one yet. Food store and stalls available mostly in the evening only or maybe because its summer.","The bathroom shower, bidet, and bathtub are not properly installed. The bathtub is too high, causing me to bruise myself on it from the first day. Additionally, their location is a bit far from prime location you maybe have to take grab taxi in hot days, it can be walkable for some or in the winter time. 
Although there is a small convenience store in front, a café next to it where youngsters gather in the evening, and good street food and seafood nearby."

Good for Families: We booked two rooms for our family of five, and the accommodations suited our family size well.

Neale,Úc,10,"Reasonable location where you can see the streets Located outside the old town, but traveling is very convenient. Phuoc has helped me a lot, please give him a raise",
Andreea,Đức,6,,"The hotel is situated in the old part of the city in a pretty busy roads intersection. The room was in a quite bad shape, with old furniture and old bath facilities. The cleanness of the room could have been done better, because there were cobwebs on the ceiling. As a summary, I was expected a 4 stars hotel, with a rate of 9 (as advertised), but in reality I would not rate this hotel more than a 7."
Sangil,Hàn Quốc,7,Normal,"It was clean, but overall the facilities were very outdated. There was a sewage smell coming from the bathroom, and the drainage was poor. The room had an old and musty smell. The dining area was small and hot despite being crowded, and I couldn't understand why they weren't using air conditioning. The food was disappointing, and due to the large number of people, it was poorly managed."
Bruno,Bồ Đào Nha,7,"The hotel itself is fine. Clean, comfortable, centrally located. Breakfast is also quite good.","However, there were a few things we did not like about the service. First, they almost lost our clothes (we did laundry with them). We needed to check out to get on a bus to Sa Pa and they were only able to track our clothes a couple of hours before (we still needed to pack). Then, for some reason the guy who did our check in decided it would be a good idea to violently knock on our door the day after to check our e-visa. I had left for a day trip but my wife and baby were both at the hotel and the clerk was super rude demanding to see our documents. Just chill"
Lisa,Vương Quốc Anh,6,Its location is just outside the old town as in not classed as old town for trip pick ups but a walkable distance. Beds are comfortable and towels are fluffy.,"Traffic noise in room as it's on a very busy road,  also the hotel is in need of a refurbishment. It is very tired looking. The staff did however explain that they had recently been taken over and the company are in the process of upgrading the rooms.  Breakfast room is small and when busy you end up sharing tables."
Anugrah,Ấn Độ,7,The location of the hotel is good.,"The Breakfast! 
The hotel had the same menu for breakfast everyday, and it is a disaster.
Being a vegetarian, I had almost nothing to eat, as the so cold veg dishes were being served in the same try as the non-veg. items. They really should work on their Veg food options, and should incorporate some dishes to cater to their Indian clientele."
Olav,Paraguay,7,Location is super in the middle of Old Quarter. Deluxe Rooms are nice.,"Breakfast is rather limited and always very crowded. At breakfast the waitress pushes you to leave immediately after eating. I was having coffee and browzed on my phone when waitress was coming twice to collect the not finished cup so that you would leave. This is very strange in Asia, where normally service is superior"
Hyunju,Hàn Quốc,7,"They upgraded my room, and while the facilities were old, they were clean.","The hotel is located by the roadside, and the windows didn’t block out noise and exhaust fumes completely. A bellboy with a mole on his face carried my luggage at first and made a gesture that seemed like he was asking for a tip. However, the other bellboys were friendly. The breakfast was very disappointing."
Rettler,Ukraine,7,"Location is good, right near the Old Quarter, but it's quite noisy, because window look right on the busy street. Comfy beds.","It looks much nicer on photos. In reality it's a bit dirty, quite shabby and definitely out of shape. Also terrible smell in the lobby."
Lenny,Hàn Quốc,6,"The breakfast was okay, choices to choose from. Rooms are spacious.",Improve on the internet speed. But overall it was fine.
Kayshel,Ấn Độ,5,The room was fine and the bed was comfortable,"The corridor of the floor was smelling of cigarettes, room was small and the tap water would leak and the floor would inevitably become wet."
Yahya,Saudi Arabia (Ả-rập Xê-út),2,"A hotel less than one star, with all due respect to them. Everything is normal, and I will not repeat my visit to any other hotel except this one.",👎🏽 I did not enjoy my stay and the breakfast was very bad.
Amely,Đức,7,"Great location!
Cleaned was ok.",WiFi is so weak in the rooms!
Amely,Đức,7,"Great Location and overall good service!
Breakfast was sufficient but not very diverse.","Didn’t provide Safe Box from the beginning, you have to ask for one!

Pavi,Vương Quốc Anh,7,"Decent stopover to our next location. 
The staff all was very helpful and check us into the room very quick.
Thanks to Liam who helped with our check out.","We did get confused with the other hotel.
Please bear in mind there is two hotels in hanoi with the same name.
Unfortunately the room card let some one else(other guest) staying in hotel open our door as we was sleeping at night. he apologies and left the room. not good."
Danielle,Úc,3,The doorman and location,"Let’s start with the staff, as they were the ones who welcomed us, or at least did us a favour by having us stay in their hotel.
They did not smile, they were not welcoming and they were rude. I think they are all in the wrong job and should be looking for a different industry.
The Doorman was VERY nice.
The room was huge for the price, however this place is OLD and stinky, I don’t think the carpet ever had a proper clean and it was lifting off the floor which was a HUGE hazard.
The breakfast was pretty sad as well and when I was filling up my water bottle from the cold water dispenser, a lady came and told me I couldn’t do it and had to use different water which was not cold at all.
Upon check out, I was given a feedback form and had the guy stare at me while completing it, which was quite intimidating as I was kind of forced into not being honest."
Antonio,Tây Ban Nha,7,The room is ample and clean. Breakfast was varied and good.,"Rooms was very noisy and wifi didn’t work well during my stay. I had to work from there and it was very sketchy (disconnecting frequently, not enough bandwidth for calls…). The reception was always full of suitcases and people waiting, quite stressful."
Sam,Vương Quốc Anh,4,Good location in the old quarter,"Some of the images used can be deceiving compared to what you actually get. Room was dirty, especially the bathroom. Very tired hotel that could do with some updates across the board. Breakfast was okay with some selection. Wouldn’t return to this hotel unfortunately"
Ricardo,Úc,6,The location is good and close to various tourist attractions. Staff is very friendly. Breakfast is a great option with multiple choices.,"Pictures don't meet reality, be aware. Rooms are not noise proof. So prepare yourself for old building noises like piping system. The hotel is located in a busy intersection so 24/7 noises of cars and motorcycles. The facilities are old and need serious renovation."
Zarin,Vương Quốc Anh,7,"When ever you confirm any reservation you should 
1.You should write the amount in paper
2. It should be written in international currency",
Claire,Mỹ,4,"-good location a few blocks away from the business of the old quarter but still centrally located
-room was clean","-the hotel is under transition from purchasing it from another hotel and felt disorganized and decrepit/ worn down
- a lot of broken things laying around 
-restaurant completely closed despite being advertised 
-my room was lacking basic things like hand soap and the room was weirdly organized (phone on the ground, cot bed set up, nightstand on other side of room made me feel no one had cared to rearrange it back after someone else's stay)
-they tried to charge me twice for my booking because they couldn't find my original receipt at checkout because their desk is currently just a mess of papers
-hotel reeks of cigarette smoke, super loud rooms can hear neighboring rooms and all sounds from outdoors"

Además en la cocina podrían haber hecho tortillas francesas,que huevos entiendo que si tenían como en muchos de los hoteles de la zona. Hacía mucho calor en el Hall,tenían la calefacción al máximo.

レセプションに言いに行くと、「スイートには変えるが2ベッドは出来ない」と言われた。（予約段階で2シングルで予約済み）

Another front desk staff member was excellent and helped us plan two guided tours to the Ha Giang Loop and Ninh Binh.
The hotel is clean, tidy, modern, and unique, located in a perfect spot. It's not overly luxurious, but exactly what you need. I would recommend it to my friends and will definitely come back.",

The location is also fantastic, as it's right in the heart of the Old Quarter. Thank you for giving me such a wonderful stay!",
Georgina,Vương Quốc Anh,10,"The rooms are spacious, the bed is huge, and the bathroom is very clean. Unfortunately, the weather wasn’t great during our stay, but overall, Hanoi is still beautiful in its own way. The rainy weather made it perfect for enjoying a bowl of ""chao quay"" at the end of Ngo Huyen Street, just 30 meters from the hotel—delicious and warm.

Cleanliness of room and bathroom was very good, and everything worked. Room has a small balcony and lots of daylight. The hotel is just a few paces from the Hoang Kien Lake and the old town. The street in front of the hotel can get very busy especially during weekends when the road around the lake is closed for people to enjoy the traffic free area - which is great! The street is then used as a bypass. In general, Hanoi in this area is very busy! Noise dies down after midnight. The owner/ manager and other staff of the hotel were very accommodating and friendly, their English was enough to communicate.",

Natalie,Úc,10,Amazing central location close to everything in the old quarter. The staff is attentive and helpful. We reserved 2 different rooms as we stayed in 2 separate occasions and they were both great!,
Jeffery,Mỹ,10,"The room was great, and breakfast was good, but the staff made the experience. They were so helpful, and the manager went above and beyond. I also recommend the airport transfer for about $18—it’s a much easier and safer option than dealing with fake taxis or the long bus ride.",

La navette aéroport était simple à organiser.,"À l’arrivée on m’a dit que j’ai été surclassé dans une chambre plus grande, on me donne les clés et on m’a demandé d’annuler ma réservation sur booking. C’est la première fois de ma vie qu’on me demande d’annuler ma réservation. Je ne prend pas ce risque et j’ai refusé. Arrivée dans la chambre c’était bien la taille que j’avais réservé mais en bien plus vieux. Cela ne me dérange pas que cela soit plus vieux car c’est propre. Mais cela crée une ambiance négative de me mentir et c’était mon premier jour. Heureusement tous les autres hôtels de mon séjour ne m’ont jamais redemandé d’annuler donc cela n’est pas une pratique du Vietnam mais de l’hôtel."

Lisa,Mỹ,10,"The location is quite close to the Hoan Kiem Lake. We stayed 3 separate times during our time in Northern Vietnam, using it as a home base for overnight excursions to Sapa and Ha Long Bay. The staff was friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  We were surprised that our room was ready when we arrived to drop off our bags at 10am.  We were able to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel and I recommend this. The rooftop bar was nice, and breakfast had made to order eggs as well as traditional Vietnamese breakfast foods.","It takes a bit to get used to walking in the neighborhood, with all  the cars, scooters and motorbikes. The sidewalks in the area are used for parking the scooters/motorbikes and often you have to walk in the street with all the traffic.  Crossing the road, takes practice and patience and bravery. We found walking at a steady pace across the street helps the traffic judge how to avoid you. It gets easier and more comfortable with time."
Michelle,Úc,10,"Excellent location in a quiet street 50m from the action. Perfect. Standout were the staff, Tommy and the 2 women on reception were so friendly and so helpful. We rate them 10/10. Comfy bed, good shower., really nice extensive breakfast.",No negatives at all
Charlie-maree,Úc,8,The rooms were clean and the location was amazing.

Ashman,Vương Quốc Anh,10,"We picked the Sunline Central hotel because of its location and from reading the reviews. We have to say it didn't disappoint. The location in the heart of the old quarter close to the lake was brilliant as it meant we could walk to most places. Coffee shops and restaurants are also very close by. The room was lovely and well presented, and the bed was super comfortable. It was also very quiet considering it's central location. The breakfast was exceptional. Lots to choose from for all. From continental, western, and asian tastes, there is something for everyone. With different dishes each day. All the staff are extremely friendly and will try their best to make sure your stay is the best it can be. We stayed for seven nights, and we can't recommend the Sunline Central highly enough and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if we ever come back to Hanoi. Don't miss out on a lovely experience.",We don't think there was anything we didn't like. It's an exceptional hotel in an exceptional location with exceptional staff.

Colleen,Canada,9,"The location of Sunline hotel is excellent. It's on one of the quieter streets in the old quarter and just around the corner from Hoan Kiem Lake. It was an okay sized room but had a huge bed which was very comfortable. It had a big window to the outside which is sometimes a difficult feature to get in the cities of Vietnam. Everything was clean and we were very happy with the room overall. The breakfast had alot of options and although the eating area was not that big, we never had a problem finding seating when we went for breakfast. The staff was excellent and special mention goes out to Huni (Honey) who helps us booked day trips to Halong Bay and Ninh Binh which were fabulous. She was very helpful and the two day tours she booked us were excellent choices ---trust her suggestions. They also have a rooftop bar/sitting area that has a fantastic view ---it was just too cold when we were there unfortunately. We would stay here again as we really liked the location and the staff.

We are looking forward to the experience. The hotel manager is also nice and offered my mother and I upgraded room.","If it wasn’t because of the staff and manager, we wouldn’t like it much. Although nice comfy bed and very good shower but could have been cleaner. About the location; it is located on one of the best part of old quarter and convenient but for long stay is overwhelming and too crowded. Not the hotel fault"
Rowena,Úc,9,location of the hotel was excellent.  Easy walking distance to many attractions. The roof top bar which had happy hour everyday from 4pm was a highlight .  The breakfast was outstanding. The helpfulness of the front of house staff was also exceptional.  Loved our stay and would recommend to others,The room was a little smaller than first expected but it was very satisfactory. We have no other complaints.
Emma,Vương Quốc Anh,9,"It was clean and the staff were lovely.

Mark,Vương Quốc Anh,10,"Great central location, walking distance to most attractions in Hanoi",Nothing
Archer61,Úc,10,"This was a fabulous stay. I did not have high hopes for any hotel in Vietnam because many of the reviews were brutal. This hotel was wonderful for the price (mid-range). The location was great - close to Hoan Kiem Lake (about 1 minute!), in the old quarter and close to the night market. Lots of good restaurants around and within good walking distance to Train St and Hanoi Citadel. The staff were super friendly, very accomodating and helpful. The room was a decent size and the bed was HUGE! It is a firm bed (typical of Asia) which I love but is very much personal taste. The bathroom was a decent size, the water was hot and the shower had decent water pressure. The room was clean. Bottled water is provided every day. There is a rooftop bar which has a great view - couldn't go because of three straight days of rain in Hanoi but would be lovely in good weather. I would happily return - good rooms, good location, good staff.",The only negative is the size of the dining room - I generally had an early breakfast but there are times when the room fills up and space is limited. My only drawback!
Karen,Úc,10,"Firstly. it was  the exceptional staff, who were all so friendly and ensured all our needs were met .
Emmy was outstanding , welcoming us so warmly and ensuring everything went smoothly for our stay .
The rooms were clean and comfortable with ample natural light . Beds and pillows so so comfortable !
The position of the hotel in Old Town was close by to Lake and most other sights were   in walking distance .Even though right in Old Town we weren’t bothered by the noise . Great 3 nights !!",Nothing
Carroll,Úc,8,"The location was perfect for us, close to shops, lake and restaurants.  The staff on the front desk were so friendly and helpful, they are a credit to the hotel.",

Tudor,Romania,8,you are close to everything,"-the room is extremely small, embarrassingly small. no view. 
-you can hear every fart or lovemaking from the rooms next door. 
-the maids in the morning make so much noise that it's unreal how they understand that you are on vacation and not at work. horrible"
Dennis,Đức,10,"A hotel with very cozy rooms in a quiet area as the hotel is located in a side street. Very close to the lake - great for a morning walk. Also close to the Old Quarter. The French quarter is just around the corner. But the best part is their outstanding service and hospitality of the reception stuff. Usually, many hotels in Vietnam have friendly stuff but here they are very welcoming, attentive and helpful. Even the hotel manager helps you to bring your luggage with you to the room. The breakfast offers a few western and asian food options.",

Patrick,Mỹ,10,Great location and the room was awesome.,
Zenia,Singapore,10,"Very central location, pretty good size and quite clean and comfortable. The 3 person room was bigger and more comfortable than some other nearby hotels which were more expensive. Staff was always very friendly and helpful.",The shower got cold after a while at night
David,Vương Quốc Anh,8,"Good location, very clean room, comfy bed, smart loo with built in bum gun, very helpful and friendly staff, good breakfast","The lift promotes happy hour with a photo of a cocktail and a roof bar which looks nothing like the actual bar. Once you are up there, they tell you happy hour is only for beer. Staff v apologetic and sweet but still - that’s not good."
Deimantė,Lithuania,10,"Location just perfect - the street was cozy, near the central lake. There was a lot of nice places to eat around.",The pressure of water in the shower was quite weak.
Barrett,Úc,10,"All the staff were brilliant - friendly and obliging . Emma booked my tours - wonderful 

The breakfast was amazing with care taken to ensure variety each day 

Cleaners did top job -.. 👏👏👏","I liked every aspect of the property - could not be better
Only thing I didn’t like is LEAVING 🤣"
Katerina,Hy Lạp,10,"This place was exactly what we needed for our four-day visit to Hanoi - and honestly, it exceeded our expectations. 
As travelers rather than tourists, we truly appreciate accommodations that offer great value for money while meeting our essential criteria: a very convenient yet quiet location to make the most of the city, impeccable cleanliness, a cozy interior design with smart use of space, a variety of breakfast options, and friendly staff.

Sunline Central effortlessly checked all these boxes. A special mention goes to the lovely ladies who take care of the rooms - their dedication to cleanliness, which is so important to us, did not go unnoticed!

We were also pleasantly surprised with a complimentary upgrade to a newly renovated executive twin room and loved the turquoise accents on the bed heads.",The only small detail we missed was hangers for the small towels in the bathroom—an easy fix that would add to the convenience.
Eileen,Vương Quốc Anh,10,"Lovely comfortable hotel, with good breakfast, very welcoming friendly staff.   Very close walking distance to the lake and within walking distance to most tourist attractions around Hanoi city.",
Gustavo,Brazil,10,"Location in old quarter center, located near all the turistic points, 1 block to the main lake in old quarter, 10 minutes from French Quarter, near restaurants, bars, stores and everything. The staff I can say made our 3 days better, one of the best receptions we had traveling around the world. The room was great, king siza bad maybe bigger than this, good bathroom, good amenities and good breakfast. I do recommend the Sunline Hotel and if had the opportunity would stay more days.",Nothing.

Couldn’t fault our stay here, it was great.",
Justine,Malta,9,"Great location, nice rooms, good shower.",Nothing
Oja,Phần Lan,10,"Great location for someone who wants to discover Hanoi on foot. We saw everything we wanted and didn't even have to use taxi during our stay in Hanoi. Good restaurant selection along the busy street next to the hotel. The staff was great - they agreed to split our bill to make it easier for us to divide the expenses. The staff always greeted us happily and they even got us a cake since I was celebrating my birthday. The breakfast varies each day and you can also order eggs, pancakes, french toast and soup from the chef on top of the breakfast buffet. I recommend trying french toast with strawberry jam! The hotel has a rooftop bar with a great view to the city. I'm happy we decided to stay here :)",Water pressure in the shower wasn't good but that is pretty normal everywhere in Vietnam.
Matteo,Vương Quốc Anh,9,"Possibly the best hotel I stayed at within the category during my long tour of Vietnam. Following a harrowing ten-hour-long road trip which saw me arriving at 11:30 at night the check-in staff's main concern was to see me in the room. The paperwork was tactfully left for the following day. The kind gesture went a long way. The bed felt just like a cocoon. The room was nicely put together with great views and no bad decorating or poor workmanship. Unlike other hotels in the same category, all was as expected.",If one were to split hairs the shower did not immediately reach the optimum level but  I understand this is in the process of being attended to.
Tia,Vương Quốc Anh,10,"This a great hotel, the staff are very helpful and very friendly. We received a free upgrade of our room and a gift at the end of our stay. The location of the hotel is perfect, walking distance of the old town but a quieter street to be on. I would recommend this hotel",

Najah,Malaysia,9,"10/10 for the staffs! They are so friendly and helpful. It is located at a perfect location since it isn't on the busy streets of the Old Quarter, yet so accessible to all the restaurants, shops and tourist attractions of Hanoi. The room is the perfect size, and the facilities are good for the price you paid. If you are a family (with middle age/ teen children) and looking for affordable hotels in Old Quarter for a few days, definitely give this hotel a try!",
Draycott,Luxembourg,8,"Staffs are very nice and helpful,  always pleasant. Always ready to help.

Scot,Mỹ,10,"The room was fresh, clean,  & modern.  WIFI was fast and great tv connection for Netflex.  Many chooses for breakfast.  Amy and Dan the owners were so sweet!  We walked everywhere however bikes are complementary & scooters are another option. Amy set up our driver & English speaking private tour guide. I wish I had pictures of the room to share. I only took a video.","The room had amazing natural light.  I wish there was a full length mirror for getting ready.  However, we stayed in 7 hotels during our stay and no one had a full length mirror."

Yen,Mỹ,10,"Price, location, facilities and staff",N/A
Mario,Ý,10,"First, the excellent staff. Everybody incredibly kind, But since we arranged the whole trip by ourselves, not knowing the problems during Tet Holiday, Emma, and colleagues at the front desk arranged everything for us, cabs,  moving and handling luggage, even the excursion to Halong with the few boats left during Tet,
Second: The hotel is perfectly located: very close to the lake Ho Hoan Kiem, center of Hanoi life, and to the old town, but at the same time in a small, defiladed street that avoids the chaotic and noisy lakefront traffic.
Third: we had confortable rooms on 10th floor, but overlooking  the lights of the bustling city. It is spectacular in the night.
Forth: the day we left very early, 5.30 a.m., we received two bags with breakfast inside for us, and this was useful.",We found everything perfect.
Iwona,Ba Lan,10,"Fantastic staff, they helped us with absolutely everything! So helpful, kind, well spoken. The room was small, but comfortable. Breakfast amazing, very tasty, fresh, good quality food.

Room was small, the tv also a bit old, some amenities also a bit old."

You can have a choice of egg dishes cooked to your wishes as well as Vietnamese noodle soup.

The room was prefect for the cost and was spotlessly clean with tea and coffee making facilities.

The staff one and all were excellent and made us wish we were able to stay more then one night. Hani was especially attentive and professional in her work at all times.",For the cost this little hotel is ecellent value and I really cannot complain.

Amanda,Úc,10,"- Excellent customer service. Hani and the front of house staff are exceptionally friendly, welcoming, professional and helpful. We stayed a total of 6 nights (split up with a trip to Ninh Binh in between). The team assisted us with many questions throughout our stay, called businesses on our behalf when we didn't have a local mobile number, arranged transport and luggage storage etc. I was also impressed at the details they remembered about us! They must be dealing with hundreds of travellers at a time, but their attention to detail never wavered. 
- Location is amazing! So central within the Old Quarter. We were able to walk everywhere. Only took Grab occasionally for further destinations.
- King size bed is huge and really comfortable mattress 
- Clean 
- Great water pressure/temperature

We'll definitely be staying here again on our next visit to Hanoi—the location couldn’t have been better!",
Ahmad,United Arab Emirates (Các Tiểu Vương Quốc Ả Rập Thống Nhất),10,"Everything was great. What caught my attention was the staff's approach to reception, especially customer service. I arrived at the hotel late and wanted to have a long sleep without any disturbance, so I used the Do Not Disturb sign behind the room door. The second day I woke up late and found all the toiletries behind the door, in addition to water and coffee, without me having to ask for it. In fact, this process and approach have never happened to me even in 5-star hotels. I thank the customer service team at the hotel and I will definitely visit and stay there next time.",

Would suggest: 1) a new shower head on thé hand shower, as it was calcaired up, and leaking and jetting out water in all directions +.  2) à midweek change of bedding, as we were there for 6+ nights"
Ahmad,United Arab Emirates (Các Tiểu Vương Quốc Ả Rập Thống Nhất),10,"The hotel is located very close to services and the lake, which has a variety of activities during the weekend. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I liked the reception staff, especially (Hani and Topaz), as they guided me daily about the expected weather conditions and also the most desirable sites to visit on the given day. It was as if they were tour guides in addition to their job duties. I thank all the staff and work crew at the hotel and all the best to the hotel management for managing the work system in an excellent way.",Breakfast must be American so can be a good choice for everyone

Andrew,Malaysia,10,"Very good location. Considering this is the Old Quarter (with old buildings), the Sunline Central hotel is really well maintained and in fact, in my opinion, better than many hotels of same-ranking in the Old Quarter.

Just a small suggestion that maybe they could consider some lighting at the wardrobe area.

When I was leaving there was a problem with my Grab getting to hotel.   One of the amazing young men helped me out and assisted by walking me the two blocks to where I could get my Grab. 
Excellent customer service.   Can’t say enough.   I would definitely make this my stay if I return to Hanoi."
Neren,Philippines,9,"The location is right in the middle of old town Hanoi. Walking distance to the lake and accessible to cafes, restaurants, shops, the hop-on-hop-off bus, spas in all direction. The hotel is spotless clean, staffs are super friendly and accommodating, flexible to the needs of the quests and the rooms are great too.",Will need to improve on breakfast options.
Greg,Úc,9,Great value for money hotel near the lake. Easy access to all the favourite places.,
Anna,Malaysia,10,"Here we are at Sunline Hotel for the third time, and it truly feels like my home away from home in Hanoi! This has become my go-to place whenever I visit the city. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, always going above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. They helped us arrange a very comfortable taxi to and from the airport at a very affordable rate, which made our travel so much easier.

The breakfast here is a real highlight, with plenty of fresh juices. The sandwiches the chef prepares in the morning are absolutely delicious and quickly became my favorite way to start the day.

Both the check-in and check-out processes were incredibly smooth, making our stay hassle-free from start to finish. Sunline Hotel has consistently provided excellent service, and I’m already looking forward to my next visit! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and welcoming place to stay in Hanoi. 

P.S. we have received a little parting gift from Sunline Hotel. Already missing the place!",
Anna,Malaysia,10,"This was my second stay at this wonderful hotel, and it was just as perfect as the first! This time, we were lucky enough to get an upgrade for the room with a lovely balcony, offering a beautiful city view that made our stay even more special.

The location couldn’t be better—just a 2-minute walk to the lake, where we enjoyed relaxing evenings strolling along the water. It’s also less than a minute from numerous fantastic restaurants, making it super convenient to explore Hanoi’s food scene.

Every detail was thoughtfully taken care of, and the hotel continues to exceed my expectations. I’m already looking forward to my next visit! Highly recommended for anyone visiting Hanoi.",
Anna,Malaysia,10,"I recently stayed at this hotel in Hanoi and was incredibly impressed! The location is absolutely strategic, within walking distance to most of Hanoi’s famous landmarks such as the Red Bridge, Train Street, and many renowned cafes. It's perfect for exploring the city on foot.

The rooms were immaculate, with all the amenities you might need. After a long day of sightseeing, I was grateful for the bed, which was incredibly soft and comfortable—just what I needed to recharge for the next day.

Breakfast was a treat every morning, offering a wide selection of both Western and local cuisine. Every dish was delicious, making it easy to start each day on a high note.

The staff here went above and beyond. They were professional, kind, and very attentive to every detail. They assisted me and provided all the necessary information even before my arrival, which made my stay so much smoother. A special mention goes to Ms. Hani, who truly stands out as the star of this hotel. She was always there when I needed something, with a warm smile and a helpful attitude that made me feel right at home.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a welcoming and comfortable place to stay in Hanoi!",everything was perfect

Simon,Úc,10,"Friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable clean rooms, with good facilities. Good price for an excellent location.",
Maximilian,Đức,10,"The hotel is perfectly located within the old town and we explored almost all of our stops in Hanoi by walking. The service quality and the staff are outstanding, always super nice and helpful! Rooms are spacious and clean, beds very comfortable. Breakfast was good, variety lacked a litttle. This was made up by the fact that you can order freshly made eggs, pancakes or french toast.

We also liked spending some time in the rooftop bar, especially in the early evening. Happy Hour prices are pretty good and you get some beautiful views of the city!",Laundry service was a little more expensive than average.
Martina,Thụy Sỹ,10,everything was good,
Evonne,Úc,10,"The Sunline Hotel is in an excellent location in the Old Quarter. It is located in a relatively quiet street, but only moments away from the hustle and bustle of Hoen Kiem Lake and the Night Market. It is also within walking distance to The Vietnam Women's Museum (well worth a visit), Water Puppet Theatre and other sights. 
The facilities are suitable for the price with the added bonus of a rooftop bar with good views over the city and lake. 
The service from initial booking to checking out was excellent. The reception staff organised our airport transfers as well as a day trip to Ninh Binh (well worth it) and everything went seamlessly.","We were extremely satisfied with the Sunline Hotel and would recommend to our friends for the service and location. It may lack some of the facilities (like a pool or gym) that some travellers may see as necessities, but it worked perfectly for us."
Trevor,Mỹ,10,"Fantastic location and people ,,,, the roof top bar was excellent and a Great Bartender!!!",Nothing!!!
Rotem,Israel,10,"The staff was amazing,room are spacious,clean and comfortable.",
John,Úc,10,Friendliness of staff. Good breakfast. Excellent room and view. Good doorman (Truong),"The only criticism I have occurred right at the end of my stay when I was charged 300000 fora bottle of water that I'd taken from the fridge. I should have taken the two from the tray on top of the fridge, but there was nothing to say one was payable and the other wasn't!  What a pity to spoil the good feeling right at the last moment!"
Katharina,Đức,6,Location,"The hotel is already old. Many things don't work properly. Breakfast is average, rather poor. The hotel is located in a quiet alley, which is a plus. Unfortunately, you can hear everything happening in the hallway, every guest passing by, and the elevator through the room's door. I wouldn't want to stay here longer than one night."
Marek,Slovakia,5,Location and staff were perfect.,"The problem was, that was a noise from outside - music playing in the evening. 
and since there were thin walls, you could hear every door slam from neighbours.. so the sleep wasnt very good.. mostly in the morning
breakfast was very poor, looks perfect on photos, but in reality it is sad."
Emily,Vương Quốc Anh,7,Location was perfect,Breakfast quality could be improved
Rohit,Vương Quốc Anh,6,The staff were  amazing and provided excellent and courteous service which was really nice. Great location right next to the lake in old quarter so walking distance from most attractions for tourists.,"The room was extremely small for 3 grown ups and 3 luggage with no space on open them and walk through the room. Very dated and whilst work was ongoing for renovation, if you are travelling with family and luggage then book more than 1 room or look elsewhere. Breakfast very basic and roof top bar didn’t look very appealing."
Melisa,Canada,7,"The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. The location was also excellent and within walking distance of several attractions.",The beds were too hard and the breakfast didn't have diverse fruit.
Ella,Mỹ,7,Location,"Very small room
Poor breakfast (looks unclean, no verity, the only coffee is black coffee)"
Michelle,Vương Quốc Anh,5,"The location was great, right in the centre and the staff was helpful.","It's very dated, especially the bathroom

Also could hear other rooms toilets and showers. And door banging."
Jennifer,Vương Quốc Anh,6,"The roof bar view
The staff were helpful and kind. 
The doorman opens the door for you and is always on hand to help with your bags. That is so nice. 
The bed was comfy
They looked after our bag when we went away for two days.
They had a delicious fresh green salad available for breakfast. 
They had a delicious brown bread for breakfast. 
They made eggs how you like if you asked. 
The shower was powerful and hot.","I paid £111 for this room a night which is high for Hanoi and you can stay in better hotels that are cleaner and they know how to provide good
Food and cleanliness. The room
Was unimpressive, basic. Nothing like the photos they advertise.
The room, especially the bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned for quite a while. I asked for it to be cleaned and the same dust and old dirt was around the plug hole and around the sink and mirror. Someone needs to learn how to thoroughly clean. 
The first set of towels, one was like a rag, thin and with a large hole. They changed it without problem but still it should not have been put in our room.
The roof top was closed during the day until 4pm, why!! I’m a paying guest and it is one of the major things as a guest they should have available. 
The breakfast was mediocre. Fruit was horrible and not varied, where was the passion fruit which is in season, fresh juicy pineapple. 
Juice needed to be stirred not left in dispenser as it separates, need to be able to stir it otherwise you get a glass of water. 
Our favourite cafe was next door but two to the hotel luckily. The juice and breakfast there is yummy, also great for vegan or vegetarians.  My fav juice was beetroot, orange and pineapple. The noodles are good there and the avocado on toast with egg. 

The Coffee was not nice in hotel. 
There were blood stains on the sheets. 
This hotel needs to up It’s game, I wouldn’t stay again, it is not being well managed."

It's located very close to the old quarter area and a few corners from where the Hanoi Night Market happens every weekend. If you like walking, it's within (a long) walking distance of places like Banh Mi 25 and Pho 10.

The space in itself was clean and decent. The rooms we got were quite spacious, considering other places in Vietnam. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. They helped us out with special requests for the room, adjustments with our bookings, and even offering to help us coordinate with our sleeper bus provider and advising us within travel options and destinations. It's a great place to stay if you find yourself in Hanoi.","The customer service was great, but if there's anything to improve, it might have something to do with how the lobby is utilized. I was surprised that it was a walk-up / a staircase to the lobby itself before you could ride the lift up to your room. But aside from that, there's nothing negative worth noting."

William,Úc,9,"The room was spotlessly clean upon arrival, and it was evident that great care had been taken by the housekeeping staff. They did an excellent job maintaining the space throughout my visit.",
Lucy,Vương Quốc Anh,10,The excursion arrangements that the hotel organized were fantastic!,
Sally,Mỹ,10,I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay that combines elegance and exceptional service.,
Ryan,Úc,10,"The location coudn't have been more convenient, situated right in the heart of the Old Quarter. This made it easy for us to explore local attractions, dine at nearby restaurants, and immerse ourselves in the vibrant culture of the city. Everything we wanted to see was just a short walk away, which was perfect for our family outings.The staff were incredibly helpful and attentive, especially when it came to our kids. They went out of their way to ensure that our children felt comfortable and welcomed",
Brenda,Mỹ,10,"The accommodation was not only nice but also impeccably clean, making it a comfortable retreat after a long day of exploring. The staff were exceptionally polite and attentive, always ready to assist with a smile.",
Dionw,Mỹ,5,"The location is close to everything in the Old Quarter and the staff were very kind, thank you Phoebe. Breakfast was included.","- The photos look almost nothing like the actual rooms
- Not very clean
- Very noisy. We have stayed in Old Quarter and understand the noise, but the walls are paper thin. Great stay for the hearing impaired."
Ann,Vương Quốc Anh,5,Breakfast was poor. Didn’t like the fact that reception was in the breakfast room.,The room didn’t have switches near the bed to put lights out. No real window.
China,Hà Lan,5,"The location is perfect, the food needs to be more varied, more plentiful and yet the hours should be extended until 10 am.","I would have liked to have a separate restaurant from the reception, not where the reception is in the same place where the reception receives customers, so that the customers who come can see how you eat."
Luc,Hà Lan,7,"Location, style. Desk officer nice and helpfull.","Hotel not spacious. 
Breakfast was not well organised at the first day, ok the day later."
Amin,Hà Lan,5,"The property is very clean, the bed is comfortable","The main reason for giving 5 star is that the hotel tries to sell you day tours and transportation with much higher price than outside. The same tour (and the same cruise ship) they offer to Ha long bay for 70-80$ was booked via travel agencies with (45-50$).  They offer car to the airport for 18$ while you can simply get a Grab (read it Uber) for 10$. They offered a two-way transportation ticket to Ninh Binh for 38$ while you can simply book it via 12Go half price (the pick up point is 5min walk from the hotel)
All in all, it felt like they’re trying to reap you off in any way possible"
Flysquirrel,Singapore,6,"Staff was exceptionally friendly and warm. Though the hotel was quite old, it was clean. Great location.","It is fine that breakfast variety is limited.  But the coffee that just came out from the kitchen was not hot nor warm, but cold.  Not sure when it was prepared.
Also, the bed was not comfortable. One part of the bed felt hard like a metal protuded, and when lying down, it rubs on my ribs, causing discomfort."
Rossella,Nam Phi,5,The staff tried very hard.,"There is no elevator up to reception so be prepared to take your own bags up. Same if you are on the 6th floor, the lift only goes from floors 1 to 5. I had to send breakfast back and ask for it to be cooked a little more - nobody wants raw scrambled eggs. Passable cleanliness but not exceptional."
Lamya,Pháp,7,"Perfect location in central Hanoi close to most sites, bed is confortable and room is clean. Make sure to ask for a room not facing the streets for noise","Staff smoking in the hallway, the smell can get in the room"
Lingmey,Pháp,7,"Great location. They keep some items/bags if you leave and come back.
The staff is very friendly and take a very very good care of all travelers",The breakfast could be better
Lingmey,Pháp,7,The location is great,The breakfast is not as great as we though
Stephen,Đức,6,It was really central directly in the old town.,The old town is so busy and very very loud. Some of the rooms are not looking like the pictures. We were a bit disappointed with out first room but the stuff was kind enough to let us switch rooms. The hotel in general was overall fine but smelled a bit weird and was dirty and didnt look as new as in the pictures on Booking.
Dee,Úc,7,We got a room upgrade which was fantastic. The balcony in the room is enclosed which is a bit weird so didn't feel like a balcony at all. The location is right in the heart of the old quarter so walking distance to food and markets. The staff were lovely and breakfast adequate.,The bed was hard so we took the extra blanket/quilt from the other bed and used it as a mattress topper.
Joerg,Úc,5,Very friendly staff moved us to a different room higher up away from the construction site and organized our airport transport.,The hard / worn mattresses and pillows were ridiculous - we turned the whole night and woke up every morning with a sore back / neck.
Caleb,Mỹ,7,Breakfast was good.,Very busy street
Una,Serbia,7,Location and spacious room,"It was not clean.  
And we had an unpleasant experience with the reception where at check out she told us that we had to pay for the towel because a dirty towel was left behind, I was shocked. I asked if she expected us not to use towels and to return them clean...
Of course, we didn't pay for the towel in the end."
Enzo,Bỉ,5,"Overly friendly staff, rooms are okay for the price you pay.","Breakfast didn't have much taste, not a tidy hotel. Staff kept harassing me to change my review"
Rebecca,Vương Quốc Anh,6,"Good location, quiet rooms, very comfortable beds, good shower/bathroom facilities",Breakfast was very limited and not very fresh. Coffee wasn’t great.
Kevin,Úc,7,"Location was perfect...Right in the thick of things...Rooms were ok just a little 'tired' and the breakfast was very basic but did the job! 

The staff were very good and helped with any questions and ordering taxi's etc.",
Olivia,Canada,4,Central. The staff was super friendly and welcoming.,It was very loud. The facilities are a little run down.
Virginie,Bỉ,7,"Right in the middle of the busy night life.
Everyone in the staff were really kind.
Perfectly clean.
Quick and smooth  pick up at the airport for 18$.","We had to wait for the room because it wasn't ready when we arrived at 6:00PM.
The deluxe double room supposed to be 25 sq m. was in fact 15."
Jennifer,Úc,4,Good location.,"Definitely would have paid a bit extra and stayed somewhere nicer. Pictures look great but it's run down. Things are definitely not cleaned properly. 
Wouldn't book it again."
Stevie,Vương Quốc Anh,7,the location near to the beer street,the bathroom need deep clean
Blake,Việt Nam,6,"Location, very central. Good breakfast.","Our room was super noisy.
Attached to reception, which had people ringing door bells and people being checked in , in the middle of the night.
Balcony room also made it noisy . Opened straight on to very busy street."
,Canada,10,"The staff was so helpful and friendly. I was only staying one night, and I had a lot of heavy luggage, but they helped me carry it up and down the stairs, and helped me store the bags after checkout before I needed to head to the airport to catch my flight. Breakfast was delicious, they had a good assortment of baked goods, fruit, beverages, and even specialty items like omelettes and pho. The rooms were clean and air conditioned, and the location is close to so many great spots on Old Quarter. I would definitely recommend it.",

Фото не совсем соответствуют. Да, цвет стен зеленый. А дальше все не так. Отель уставший. Находится на улице, где продают упаковку. Очень шумно, спишь как будто на оживленной улице, окна все пропускают.

Oili,Pháp,9,"Nous avons trouvé l’endroit idéal dans le vieux quartier de Hanoi ! La chambre était propre et confortable, ce qui en fait un endroit idéal pour se détendre après une journée d'exploration. Le personnel était incroyablement serviable et sympathique, ajoutant à l'expérience globale.",
Mikaela,Pháp,10,Idéalement situé et très confortable. Le personnel était sympathique et compétent.,
Arthur,Pháp,10,"La chambre était bien organisée et tout était à sa place, ce qui contribuait à une sensation de calme et de détente. Le lit était accueillant, avec des draps frais et impeccables qui m'ont fait me sentir à l'aise et comme chez moi tout de suite.",
Géraldine,Pháp,6,"L’emplacement, les lits","Les fenêtres ne ferment pas bien donc on entend tout le bruit de la rue …
Fourmis au niveau du petit-déjeuner 
On a vu un cafard à la réception… 😖"
Anne,Pháp,7,Situé dans la vieille ville .,"Trop Bruyant , car il donne sur une rue .
Salle du petit déjeuner exiguë, devant le bureau de l’accueil."
Monia,Ý,6,La posizione nel centro della città vecchia,"La camera e l’albergo erano datati , la pulizia un po’ superficiale, la sala colazione non era una sala riservata ma erano messi questi tavolini nella piccola hall dell’albergo che rimane al piano superiore e che per fare colazione la mattina stavi appiccicata con le sedie ad altri ospiti, inoltre finivano le cose dal buffet e dovevi dirle allo staff perché non guardavano e prima di rifornire aspettavamo parecchio. Potrebbero fare la hall nel piano sotto invece di tenere un divanetto inutile.. tra l’altro le poltrone dove ti siedi erano tutte macchiate."
Serge,Canada,5,Petit déjeuner le personnel très gentil,"Beaucoup de bruit , lit très ordinaire, petite chambre chambre de bain trop p’tit"
Vivi,Đan Mạch,6,Sødt personale,Småt værelse og meget larm og morgenmaden var dårlig og kedelig
Pierre,Pháp,5,Hôtel bien situé dans un quartier super animé avec de nombreux restaurants à proximité immédiate.,"Chambre avec un plafond bas, pas de porte bagage, une seule table de chevet, éclairage style spot éblouissant, matelas complètement defoncé, salle de petit déjeuner exiguë et petit déjeuner super basique."
Philip,Đức,7,"• Gute, zentrale Lage
• Sauberes, klimatisiertes Zimmer mit großem Badezimmer
• Freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal 
• Unterstützung bei Ausflugsplanung","• Frühstücksbuffet mit sehr eingeschränkter Auswahl an simplen Speisen
• Zimmer zur Straße mit leichtem Verkehrs- und Baustellenlärm"
Soraya,Pháp,7,L'emplacement est pratique.,"Le bruit était considérable et ne correspond pas trop aux photos.
Point d'amélioration : la propreté par rapport au tarif."
Mrvic,Nga,7,"Комната метров 20 и примерно 3 ванная. В номере чисто. Постельное бельё ощущается как очень чистое и свежее. Полотенца тоже чистые, правда от них исходит немного химический запах. В номере почти успешная попытка выдержать единый дизайн. Одна стена тёмно-зелёного цвета, остальные стены очень светлые, оттенок зелёного. Изголовье кровати и остальная мебель – тёмно-тёмно коричневые, почти чёрные. Сочетается хорошо. Стул тоже тёмный, а сиденье у него – зеленоватое. Увы, на окне – красная штора. Вид на стену, блок кондиционера и пожарную лестницу. Над кроватью - старинное фото.  Кондиционер слабенький. Хотя он не выглядит старым, но с установленной температурой 17 градусов еле-еле охлаждает комнату. Вероятно, его мощность на комнату метров 10-12. Установлен на стене напротив кровати и дует на одну половину кровати, поскольку кровать очень большая. Телевизор примерно 26 или 32 дюйма. Маленький холодильничек, пустой. Над холодильником «чайный уголок»: чайник, 2 чашки, 2 пакетика растворимого кофе, 2 пакетика чая, 2 небольшие бутылки воды. Большой шкаф с вешалками, сменной обувью (вьетнамки) и запасными полотенцами. Над столом зеркало. По бокам от кровати тумбочки. 
Ванная: дверь до конца не закрывается, пол чистый, хорошая душевая кабина. Сантехника старенькая. Крепление гибкого душа сломано, закреплено пластиковым хомутиком. Есть шампунь и гель для душа. Нормальный унитаз, туалетная бумага лежит на бачке, держателя не предусмотрено. Вода есть, хороший напор. Но, если вечером горячая вода пошла быстро, то утром пришлось сливать минут 10, пока появилась возможность мыться, а не закаляться. Симпатичная раковина. Есть наборы зубная щётка/зубная паста, одноразовая бритва, шапочки для душа, расчёска. Но нет мыла. 
С розетками почти хорошо: двойная розетка в ванной, розетка над столом и под столом и двойная около чайника. Но ни одной розетки у изголовья – т.е. положить телефон на зарядку рядом с собой на ночь нельзя. Около входа в в ванную 2 выключателя – свет и вытяжка.","Полный провал с завтраком. В день заезда меня уверяли, что завтракать можно с 6-30. Мне рано надо было уезжать и это было важно. Пришёл в 6-40. В это время начали всё раскладывать. Вижу, стоят 2 чайника  - чай и кофе. Трогаю – оба абсолютно холодные. Спросил сотрудника, ответ «One minute». Стоит графин с жёлтой жидкостью – наверное что-то апельсиновое. К счастью, я сначала потрогал стенку графина. Просто кипяток. Спрашиваю сотрудника – «Что это?» «Orange juice». «Но он горячий». Сотрудник трогает графин, с криком отдергивает руку. Вероятно, они разводят какой-то порошок и, чтобы побыстрее разошёлся – в кипятке. То есть, напиток они решили приготовить поутру, а чай и кофе – заранее, с вечера. Жуть. Увидел стоящий рядом кулер с водой – налил «холодной» воды. Кулер тоже не работает, поэтому вода просто тёплая. Стоит хлеб, рядом тостер. Пытаюсь включить – тостер не работает. Обращаюсь к тому же сотруднику. Он несколько раз нажимает на клавишу. После каждого нажатия смотрит на тостер – ничего не происходит. «One minute». Через какое-то время сотрудникам удалось запустить тостер, и я добыл обжаренный хлеб. Сыра, колбасы не было. Омлет просил дважды, прежде чем принесли. Омлет вполне нормальный, но пришлось поискать соль. Попросил масло. Паренёк озирается, ищет. Ничего не находит, идёт на кухню и мне на стол принес миску с замороженным маслом. Я попробовал постругать, но не особо в этом преуспел. Немного позже на завтрак пришла семья с детьми – они просили масло у меня, т.к. другого не было. Сыр, кажется, появился после семи часов, но я уже уходил, мне надо было успеть на автобус. 
Возможно, для туристов, пришедших часам к восьми, всё выглядело нормально. Чай и кофе к тому времени разогрели, напиток остыл, масло разморозилось и так далее. Я же очень порадовался наличию чайника в номере. По крайней мере, мне удалось запить съеденные хлеб и омлет свежим, а не вчерашним чаем – пусть и из пакетика."
Cleo,Pháp,7,L’emplacement,
Miquel,Tây Ban Nha,3,Eatava forç net,"Molt sorollós, a les 6.30h del matí ja no hem pogut dormir més pel soroll del personal preparant esmorzar (per cert, esmorzar pèssim).
Vam demanar llit extragran i eren dos junts.
Finalment, el personal molt ineficient (excepte una noia jove molt agradable i eficient)."
Eider,Tây Ban Nha,1,Lamentablemente no puedo decir nada bueno de este alojamiento,"Las fotos no se corresponden con las de booking. La habitación es amplia pero está llena de polvo de hacía mucho tiempo, no tenía ventana y en el baño había un agujero en la ducha que mientras te duchabas te entraba la lluvia. La TV no funcionaba. El personal era extremadamente ruidoso y había gritos tarde por la noche y muy pronto por la mañana. Además el hotel estaba en obras, espero que para mejorar, pero no te avisan y las sufres mientras están trabajando. El desayuno no vale nada, es mejor desayunar por tu cuenta, no había nada y lo que había estaba pasado. La ubicación no está mal si  buscas alojarte en el old quarter pero hay calles mucho mejores que esta."
Ka,Hồng Kông,5,員工很有善，提供協助，很有禮貌,環境十分破舊，毛巾十分殘舊，像用了很多年一樣
